    <h2>
      CHAPTER I. IN MY LADY'S CHAMBER.
    </h2>
    <p class="pfirst">
      <span class="dropcap" style="font-size: 4.00em">I</span>T is an hour short
      of midnight, and the depth of winter. The morrow is Christmas Day. Mirk
      Abbey bears snow everywhere; inches thick upon its huge broad
      coping-stones; much even on its sloping roof, save on the side where the
      north wind makes fitful rushes, and, wolf-like, tears and worries the
      white fleeces. Mirk woods sway mournfully their naked arms, and grind and
      moan without; the ivy taps unceasingly against the pane, as though
      entreating shelter.
    </p>
    <p>
      The whole earth lies cold and dead beneath its snow-shroud, and yet the
      snow falls and falls, flake by flake, soft and noiseless in its white
      malice, like a woman's hate upon her rival.
    </p>
    <p>
      It hides the stars, it dims the moon, it dulls the murmur of the river to
      which the Park slopes down, and whose voice the frost has striven in vain
      to hush these three weeks. Only the Christmas-bells are heard, now faint,
      now full--that sound more laden with divine regret than any other that
      falls on human ear. Like one who, spurring from the battle-field,
      proclaims &ldquo;The fight is ours, but our great chief is slain!&rdquo; there is
      sorrow in that message of good tidings; and not only for pious Christian
      folk; in every bosom it stirs some sleeping memory, and reminds it of the
      days that are no more. No wonder, then, that such music should touch my
      Lady's heart--the widowed mistress of Mirk Abbey. Those Christmas-bells
      which are also wedding-bells, remind her doubtless of the hour when Sir
      Robert lifted her lace-veil aside, and kissed her brow before all the
      people in the little church by the sea, and called her for the first time
      his Wife. He will never do so more. He has been dead for years. But what
      of that? Our dead are with us still. Our acts, our dealings with the
      world, form but a portion of our lives; our thoughts still dwell with
      those dear ones who have gone home before us, and in our dreams they still
      are our companions. My Lady is not alone in her private chamber, although
      no human being is there besides herself. Her eyes are fixed upon the fire,
      and in its flame she sees a once-loved face invisible to others, whose
      smile has power to move her even to tears. How foolish are those who
      ascribe romance to Youth alone &mdash;to Youth, that has scarcely learned
      to love, far less to lose! My Lady is five-and-forty at the least,
      although still comely; and yet there are memories at work within that
      broad white brow, which, for interest and pathos, outweigh the fancies of
      a score of girls. Even so far as we&mdash;the world&mdash;are acquainted
      with her past, it is a strange one, and may well give her that thoughtful
      air.
    </p>
    <p>
      Lady Lisgard, of Mirk Abbey, has looked at life from a far other station
      than that which she now occupies. When a man of fortune does not
      materially increase his property by marriage, we call the lady of his
      choice, although she may have a few thousand pounds of her own, &ldquo;a girl
      without a sixpence.&rdquo; But Sir Robert Lisgard did literally make a match of
      this impecunious sort. Moreover, he married a very &ldquo;unsuitable young
      person;&rdquo; by which expression you will understand that he was blamed, not
      for choosing a bride very much junior to himself, but for not selecting
      her from the proper circles. When accidentally interrogated by blundering
      folks respecting her ancestry, the baronet used good-humouredly to remark,
      that his wife was the daughter of Neptune and Thetis. When asked for her
      maiden name, he would reply drily: &ldquo;She was a Miss Anna Dyomene;&rdquo; for the
      simple fact was, that she had been thrown up almost at his feet by the sea&mdash;the
      sole survivor of a crowded emigrant-ship that went to pieces before his
      eyes while he was staying one stormy autumn at a sea-side village in the
      South. Lashed to a spar, the poor soul came ashore one terrible night in a
      very insufficient costume, so as to excite the liveliest compassion in all
      beholders. There was a subscription got up among some visitors of fashion
      to supply her with a wardrobe; and they do say that Sir Robert Lisgard's
      name is still to be seen set down with the rest of the benevolent donors,
      for five pounds, in the list that is kept among the archives of the
      village post-office.
    </p>
    <p>
      But it was not until three years afterwards that he bought her a <i>trousseau</i>;
      for the baronet, intending to make her his wife not only in name&mdash;a
      companion for life, and not a plaything, which is prized so long as it is
      new, and no longer&mdash;caused Lucy Gavestone, during the greater part of
      that interval, to be educated for her future position. If it was madness
      in him, as many averred, to marry so far beneath him, there was much
      method in his madness, Not ashamed of her as a bride, he was resolved not
      to be ashamed of her as the mistress of his house, or as the mother of his
      children, if it should please Heaven to grant him issue. It was in France,
      folks said, that her Ladyship acquired those manners which subsequently so
      excited the envy of the midland county in which she lived. She bore the
      burden of the honours unto which she was not born as gracefully as the
      white rose in her blue-black hair. But to perform her loving duties as a
      mother, in the way even her enemies admitted that she did perform them,
      could scarcely have been learned in France. Only love and natural good
      sense could have taught her those. Never once had Sir Robert Lisgard cause
      to regret the gift which the sea had given him. He used, however,
      smilingly to remark, in his later years &mdash;and his words were not
      without their pathos then&mdash;that he wished that he could have married
      his Lucy earlier, and while he was yet a young man; but in that case she
      would have been fitter for the font than the altar, inasmuch as there was
      a quarter of a century between their respective ages. He always averred
      that five-and-twenty years of his manhood had been thrown away.
    </p>
    <p>
      But good wife and matron as Lady Lisgard had been, she was no less
      excellent a widow and mother. If Sir Robert could have risen from that
      grave in Mirk churchyard, where he had preferred to lie, rather than in
      the family vault, so that she might come to visit him in his lonely sleep,
      and daily lay a flower or two, culled with her own hands, upon him&mdash;not
      perhaps unconscious of that loving service&mdash;he would have found all
      things at the Abbey as he would have wished them to be during life: that
      is, so far as she could keep them so. Sir Richard, their eldest son, was
      within a few months of his majority, and, of course, had become in a great
      degree his own master; not that he misused his years so as to place
      himself in opposition to his mother, for he was a gentleman above
      everything; but he was of a disposition more haughty and stern than her
      kindly nature could well cope with, and she nervously shrank from any
      contest with it, although, on a question of principle&mdash;which,
      however, had not occurred&mdash;she might have braved even him.
    </p>
    <p>
      Walter Lisgard, the younger son, was as genial and good-humoured as his
      father before him, and although (in common with every one who knew her)
      loved and respected my Lady, it must be confessed that he was too openly
      his mother's favourite, as he was the favourite of all at Mirk, in the
      Abbey or out of it.
    </p>
    <p>
      Lastly, there was Letty Lisgard&mdash;but she shall speak for her sweet
      self. While her mother sits and thinks before her fire, there is a knock
      at the chamber-door, and on the instant the picture in her brain
      dissolves, which was affecting her so deeply, and she has no eyes save for
      her only daughter. A girl of seventeen enters the room, not gaily, as
      would have become her age, but with a certain gentle gravity that becomes
      her at least as well, since it is impossible to imagine that she could
      look more lovely. Fair as a lily, but not pale, for her usually delicate
      colour is heightened by some mental emotion, which causes, too, the little
      diamond cross upon her bosom to rise and fall, and the hazel eyes to melt
      and glitter beneath their dark lashes; lithe and tall as a sapling wooed
      too roughly by the north wind, she glides in, with her fair head slightly
      bowed, and casting herself upon her knees beside my Lady, exclaims: &ldquo;Ah,
      do not weep, dear mother&mdash;do not weep!&rdquo; at the same time herself
      bursting into a passion of tears. &ldquo;I knew what you would be thinking of,&rdquo;
       continues she, &ldquo;upon this sad night, and therefore I came to comfort you a
      little, if I could. If not a merry Christmas, let me at least wish you a
      happy one, my own dear mother. I am sure that if dear papa can see us now,
      he wishes you the same.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes, dearest Letty, that is true. How thoughtful and kind it was of you
      to leave your friend&mdash;breaking off, no doubt, some pleasant chat over
      school-days&rdquo;&mdash;&mdash;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Nay, mother,&rdquo; interrupted the girl; &ldquo;what is Rose to me in comparison
      with you? Was it likely that I should forget this anniversary of our
      common loss!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Lady Lisgard did not answer in words, but shedding by the wealth of golden
      brown hair that had fallen over her daughter's forehead, she kissed that
      pure brow tenderly. Upon her own cheeks, a crimson flush, called thither
      by the young girl's words, was lingering yet. Reader, happy are you if you
      have never known a loving voice say: &ldquo;What are you thinking of, dearest?&rdquo;
       expecting to receive the answer: &ldquo;Of you,&rdquo; when you have no such reply to
      give&mdash;when your mind has been wandering far from that trustful being,
      and perhaps even whither it should not have wandered. Such a flush may
      then have visited your cheeks, as now touched those of Lady Lisgard,
      although it is certain that memory never played <i>her</i> so false as to
      remind her of aught whereof she need have been ashamed. The fact was, she
      had not been thinking of Sir Robert at all, albeit it was upon that very
      day, five years back, that she had received from his failing hand its last
      loving pressure, and in that very room. Human nature cannot be trained
      like those wondrous mechanical inventions of the monks, that indicated the
      fasts and festivals of the church so accurately&mdash;to suffer or rejoice
      at particular times and seasons; we are often sad when the jest is upon
      our lips, and bear a light heart beneath the sackcloth. Lady Lisgard's
      thoughts had, Heaven knew, been far from merry ones; but because she had
      not been mourning with chronological propriety, her woman's heart unjustly
      smote her with a sense of want of fealty to the memory of him for whom she
      still wore&mdash;and intended to wear to her dying day&mdash;the visible
      tokens of regret.
    </p>
    <p>
      It is the fashion to jeer at widows; but, to a reverent mind, there are
      few things more touching than that frequent sight in honest England&mdash;a
      widowed mother, whose only joy seems to be in what remains to her of her
      dead lover, husband, counsellor&mdash;his children; and the only grief
      that has power to wring whose heart, past sense of common pain through the
      dread anguish that it has once undergone, arises from their misfortunes
      and misdoings. Ah, selfish boy, beware how you still further burden that
      sorrow-laden soul!&mdash;ah, thoughtless girl, exchange not that faithful
      breast too hastily for one that may spurn your head in the hour of need!
    </p>
    <p>
      My Lady&mdash;for that was what we always called her about Mirk&mdash;was
      neither more nor less fortunate with her children than most mothers. They
      all three loved her; but they did not all love one another. Between Sir
      Richard and Walter was only a year of time, but upon it had arisen a
      thousand quarrels. The former thought that the privilege of an elder
      brother was a divine right, extending over every circumstance of fraternal
      life; the latter conceived it to be an immoral institution, borrowed in an
      evil hour from the Jews, and one to be strictly kept within its peculiar
      limits&mdash;themselves more than sufficiently comprehensive&mdash;the
      inheritance of the family title, and the succession to the landed estates.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Where are Richard and Walter, Letty?&rdquo; asked Lady Lisgard, breaking a long
      silence. &ldquo;They, too, have been always mindful, like yourself, of this sad
      day.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;They are mindful still, dear mother. I hear Walter's foot in the corridor
      even now.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      A swift elastic footfall it was, such as is very suggestive of the
      impulsive nature of him who uses it; for a phlegmatic man may move swiftly
      on rare occasions&mdash;such as bayonets behind him, or a mad bull&mdash;but
      there will be no more elasticity in his gait, even then, than in that of a
      walking-doll; whereas every step of Captain Walter Lisgard had a double
      action, a rise and fall in it, independent of the progressive motion
      altogether.
    </p>
    <p>
      He was of a slim, yet not delicate build; his every movement (and, as I
      have said, there was plenty of it) had a native grace like that of a
      child; childlike and trustful, too, were those blue eyes; soft in their
      expression as his sister's, while he stooped down to kiss his mother's
      cheek, scarce more smooth than his own. Upon his lip, however, was a fairy
      moustache, which being, fortunately, coal-black like his somewhat
      close-cropped hair, made itself apparent to all beholders, and rescued his
      comeliness from downright effeminacy. But no woman ever owned a softer
      voice, or could freight it with deeper feeling than Walter Lisgard.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;God bless you, dearest mother, and give you all the good you deserve!&rdquo;
       murmured he tenderly.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;And God bless <i>you</i>, my darling!&rdquo; answered Lady Lisgard, holding him
      at the full distance of her white and rounded arms, clasped with two
      costly jewels, which had a worth, however, in her eyes far beyond their
      price, being Sir Robert's wedding-gift. &ldquo;Ah me! how you remind me of your
      father's picture, Watty, taken on the day when he came of age. I trust you
      will grow up to be like him in other respects, dear boy.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I hope so, mother; although,&rdquo; added he, with a sudden petulancy, &ldquo;there
      will be a vast difference between us in some things, you know. He was an
      only son, whereas I am not even an eldest one; and when <i>I</i> come of
      age, there will be no picture taken, nor any fuss made, such as is to
      happen in June, I hear, upon Richard's majority.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Walter, Walter!&rdquo; exclaimed Lady Lisgard reprovingly, &ldquo;this is not like
      yourself, for it's envious&mdash;and&mdash;and&mdash;covetous!&rdquo;&mdash;&mdash;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;At all events, it is very foolish, mother,&rdquo; interrupted the young man
      drily; &ldquo;for what can't be cured must be endured.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;And very, very cruel to me,&rdquo; added Lady Lisgard.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Then I am sincerely sorry I spoke,&rdquo; returned Walter hastily, the
      moodiness upon his features chased away at once by loving regret. &ldquo;Only,
      when a fellow leaves his regiment to spend Christmas-eve at home&mdash;as
      I am sure I was delighted to do, so far as you and Letty were concerned&mdash;he
      does not want to find there another commanding officer, uncommissioned and
      self-appointed.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Walter, Walter! this is very sad,&rdquo; broke in Lady Lisgard piteously: &ldquo;you
      know what is Richard's manner, and how much less kind it is than his true
      meaning. Can you not make some allowance for your own brother?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;That's exactly what I said to <i>him</i>, mother,&rdquo; answered Walter,
      laughing bitterly. &ldquo;Here have I just got my troop, with no more to keep
      myself on than when I was a cornet, and had no back debts to speak of; and
      yet, so far from helping me a little, as Richard might easily do, by <i>making
      some allowance for his own brother</i>, he complains of that which you are
      so good as to let me have out of your own income. Why, that's not <i>his</i>
      business, if it were twice as much&mdash;although, I am sure, dear mother,
      you are liberality itself. Has he not got enough of his own&mdash;and of
      what should be mine and Letty's here, by rights&mdash;without grudging me
      your benevolences? Is he not Sir Richard Lisgard of Mirk Abbey?&rdquo;&mdash;&mdash;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I will not listen to this, Walter,&rdquo; cried his mother sternly. &ldquo;This is
      mere mean jealousy of your elder brother.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh, dear no, mother; indeed, it is not that,&rdquo; answered the young man
      coldly. &ldquo;I envy him nothing. I hold him superior to me in no respect
      whatever; and that is exactly why I will not submit to his dictation. Here
      he comes stalking along the gallery, as though conscious that every foot
      of oak belongs to him, and every picture on the wall.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      It was undoubtedly a firm determined step enough&mdash;unusually so, for
      one so young as Sir Richard. The face of the new-comer, too, was stern
      almost to harshness; and as he entered the room, and beheld Walter
      standing by his mother's side, his features seemed to stiffen into stone.
      A fine face, too; more aristocratic if not so winning as his younger
      brother's, and not without considerable sagacity: if his manner was not
      graceful, it had a high chivalric air about it which befitted his haughty
      person very well. When he taught himself submission (a rare lesson with
      him), as now, while he raised his mother's fingers to his lips, and kissed
      them with dutiful devotion, it would have been hard to find a man with a
      more noble presence than Richard Lisgard.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;A merry Christmas and a happy New Year to you, mother.&rdquo; The words, though
      conventional, had an earnest kindness, which came from the heart. Lady
      Lisgard kissed him fondly.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Thank you, dear Richard,&rdquo; said she; &ldquo;but, alas! no Christmas can be a
      merry one, no year a happy one, when I see my children disagree.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Ah, Master Walter has been here before me, I see,&rdquo; quoth Sir Richard
      bitterly, &ldquo;stealing, like Jacob, his mother's blessing from her
      first-born, and giving his own account of matters. But please now to
      listen to <i>my</i> version.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Not to-night, Richard,&rdquo; exclaimed Lady Lisgard with deep emotion. &ldquo;Let
      not tonight, sacred to the memory of your common father, be a witness to
      your mutual accusations. In this room, almost at this very hour, but a few
      years back, he died, bequeathing you with his last breath to my tenderest
      care. Here it was that you kissed his white lips, weary with prayers for
      your future welfare; here it was that you promised, in return, to be good
      and dutiful sons. I know&mdash;I think, at least&mdash;that you both love
      your mother. No, I will kiss neither of you while thus unreconciled. That
      was not all that he required of you: he would have bidden you, could he
      have looked forward to this evil time, to love one another also; and O
      Richard! O Walter! hark to those bells, that seem to strive to beat their
      message into the most stubborn ears. Do you not hear what they say?&mdash;Letty,
      dear, do you tell them, then, for there are no lips better suited to
      deliver it.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      The young girl lifted up her head from her mother's lap, to gaze into her
      eyes; then, with exquisite pathos and softness, repeated, like a silver
      peal of bells: &ldquo;Peace and good-will, peace and good-will, peace and
      good-will to all mankind.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Sir Richard looked at his brother fixedly, but no longer in wrath. &ldquo;It is
      my part to make the first advance,&rdquo; said he, &ldquo;although I was not the first
      to quarrel;&rdquo; and he frankly stretched forth his hand.
    </p>
    <p>
      The other paused a second; then reading on his mother's anxious lips: &ldquo;For
      <i>my</i> sake, Walter,&rdquo; he grasped his brother's fingers. There was grace
      in the very delay, as in the motion tenderness and genial ease, but
      scarcely the warmth of reconciliation. It was more like the action of a
      woman who wishes to please; and if you had seen the small hand apart from
      its owner, as it lay with its one glittering ring half hid in the other's
      huge white palm, you would have said it was a woman's hand.

      CHAPTER II. THE WAITS.
    </h2>
    <p class="pfirst">
      <span class="dropcap" style="font-size: 4.00em">O</span>NCE more my Lady
      is alone, except for her companion-thoughts, which are, however, no longer
      of a distressing nature. The reconcilement of her boys has gladdened her
      to the core: she thinks, she trusts at least, that the truce will be a
      lasting peace. As for Letty, she is all that a mother's heart could wish
      her to be. If much is lost to my Lady, surely much remains. With the Poor,
      one misery is removed only to bring another into greater prominence; but
      with the Rich, this is not so. Only let the disease be cured, or the
      quarrel be made up, which is at present vexing them, and all, for a time
      at least, is sunshine. Even not to be cold, not to be hungry, is
      something; and not to have to take thought of the morrow is a great deal.
      From her warm and curtained chamber, Lady Lisgard looks forth into the
      night. The snow falls as fast as ever, now straight, now aslant, now
      whirled in circular eddies by the bitter north. Through its thick and
      shifting veil, she can scarcely see the old church-tower of Mirk, though
      it stands close by within the very garden-grounds of the Abbey; nor the
      windmill which crowns Mirkland Hill, and on moonlit nights stands up so
      clear against the sky, a beacon to all the country round. It was weather
      which those who are armed against it call &ldquo;Seasonable;&rdquo; and some of the
      tender sex, who have a fire lit in their rooms before they rise, and go
      out in seal-skin, and travel with foot-warmers, even go so far as to call
      &ldquo;Delightful.&rdquo; At all events, it is such as is pleasant to watch from
      within for a few moments, and then to return to one's fireside with
      enhanced satisfaction.
    </p>
    <p>
      There are merry-makings in the kitchen to-night, as befits the season, and
      my Lady's maid has been enjoined not to hurry herself. Her mistress is
      beginning to unrobe, without her assistance, but very leisurely. She
      unclasps one warm and sparkling jewel from her arm, and gazes
      thoughtfully, but far from sadly, upon the picture that is hid within it.
      It is the miniature of a handsome man past middle age, attired in a blue
      coat and gold buttons; what persons of my Lady's age would call a
      decidedly old-fashioned portrait; but it is the likeness of Sir Robert as
      her bridegroom. &ldquo;What a good, kind husband he was,&rdquo; thinks she. &ldquo;How he
      loved me, and loaded me with favours; how much he overlooked, how much he
      forgot&mdash;of which others know nothing&mdash;for my sake. How terrible
      would it be to feel that one had not done one's poor duty in return for so
      much love. Thank Heaven, I feel free from any such charge. If I had not
      love&mdash;that is, first love&mdash;to give him in exchange, I gave him
      all I had. I gave him genuine affection, esteem&mdash;worship. Everybody
      knows that; and what is better, my own heart knows it. It never beat with
      truer fealty towards him than it beats to-night. God knows. I live for his
      children only. What a fine noble boy is Richard grown; surely, to look
      upon him, and to say to one's self: 'This is my son,' should be happiness
      enough for any mother. True, he is proud; but has he not something to be
      proud of? He, Sir Richard, and one of those Lisgards who have ruled at
      Mirk for twelve generations. (Here a quiet smile stole over my Lady's
      features.) They said with reason at those <i>tableaux</i> at the Vanes,
      that with that helmet on he was the image of young Sir Maurice, who died
      at Edgehill with the colours twisted round him. I wonder if it was his
      poor mother who had her dead boy painted so. 'Tis certain that she
      thought: 'Ah, were he but alive, there would be no such thing as sorrow
      more for me.' Yet here I have him. Ah (here she grew as pale as death),
      why did <i>I</i> ever let my Walter be a soldier? What weakness to give
      way&mdash;to the very peril of him for whom I was so weak! He would have
      gone to the wars themselves but for good Dr Haldane, through whom (thanks
      to the Duke) he was not gazetted to the corps he had applied for. Why did
      he not choose the bar, like his elder brother? How he would have moved
      men's hearts to mercy with that winning tongue! Or why did he not become
      God's messenger&mdash;I am sure he has an angel's face&mdash;and carry the
      news those bells are telling of to shipwrecked souls? Oftentimes, when, as
      a child, he knelt beside me to say his prayers, his very looks have seemed
      to make the action more sacred. Goodness seemed better worth when he was
      praying for it, and heaven no home for saints unless he shared it! God
      grant he may grow up a good man!
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Then Letty, too&mdash;what mother's wealth must I possess since that
      sweet girl is not the chief of it, the central jewel of my crown? When
      matched with others of her age&mdash;with this Rose Aynton, for example&mdash;how
      bright and fair she shews! Not but that Rose is a good girl, doubtless;
      accomplished, too, beyond her years, and far beyond her opportunities&mdash;she
      sparkles like a crystal cut in ten thousand facets; but my own Letty is
      the flawless diamond, bright and pure as light itself. What blessings are
      these three! May Heaven keep them always as I deem them now. I wish my
      Walter were a little less impulsive; but the darling boy is young. As for
      dear Richard, I have no fears for him. The proud lad will find some noble
      helpmate, meet to&mdash;&mdash;Great Heaven! what is that?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      A burst of melody without fell suddenly upon the midnight air, and at the
      same moment the chamber-door opened to the touch of Mistress Forest, her
      Ladyship's confidential maid. &ldquo;I beg your pardon, my Lady, if I startled
      you; but I knocked twice, and could not make you hear.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;It was not you, Mary, that startled me,&rdquo; returned Lady Lisgard; &ldquo;it was
      the sudden music. The Christmas Waits, as I suppose?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes, my Lady. They came up from the village a little while ago, and have
      been staying in the servants-hall for the clock to strike twelve.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I trust they have all had supper?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You may be sure of that, my Lady. Mrs Welsh is as openhanded (with your
      Ladyship's property) as any cook in the county; nor is George Steve a
      likely man to sit thirsty while he sees others drink. One would think that
      a public-housekeeper should have drinking enough at home; but&mdash;pardon,
      my Lady&mdash;I am making complaints which, however just, I know you
      dislike to hear, and, besides, I am interrupting the carol.&rdquo;

      Here the manly but not unmelodious voices exchanged their verse for prose,
      if Christmas good-wishes can be said to be mere prose. &ldquo;A merry Christmas
      and a happy New Year to your Ladyship, and many on 'em!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Lady Lisgard moved to the window with a smile, and drawing the curtain
      aside, threw up the sash. On the white lawn beneath, stood five dark
      figures, bearing various instruments of music, and one a huge horn
      lantern, the light of which glinted upon the laurels. It was impossible to
      recognise the features of the rest, as they stood, cap in hand,
      notwithstanding the still driving snow, awaiting her Ladyship's reply; but
      she addressed them each by name nevertheless.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Mr Steve, I thank you kindly. Henry Ash, I am glad to find you in good
      voice again. John Lewis and Peter Stone&mdash;if I am not mistaken.
      Neighbours and friends all, I thank you very much. But it is a cold night
      for caroling, and I hope you have been taken care of within. A merry
      Christmas to you and a happy New Year.&rdquo; There was a tremor in my Lady's
      voice, although she spoke with such particularity, which shewed how deeply
      she was moved.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;God bless your Ladyship,&rdquo; returned the voices, disorderly as to unison,
      but each one of itself distinct and clear as file-firing.&mdash;&ldquo;God bless
      Sir Richard, and send him a fair bride.&mdash;God bless Master Walter's
      handsome face.&mdash;God bless Miss Letty.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Lady Lisgard closed the window, but as she did so, dropped the heavy
      curtain between herself and the lighted chamber, so that she could still
      look out, but without being seen. The curtain, too, cut her off from the
      observation of her maid within. &ldquo;Who is the fifth man that bears the
      lantern, Mary?&rdquo; asked her Ladyship in a tone of carelessness very unsuited
      to the expression of her face, which all in a moment had grown pinched and
      terror-stricken, as though it hungered for some reply that it yet dreaded
      to hear.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Nobody as you know, my Lady&mdash;nor indeed as <i>I</i> know, for the
      matter of that. He's a stranger in these parts, who's putting up at the <i>Lisgard
      Arms</i>. He only came for a few days last week, walking across the
      country for all the world like a pedler&mdash;a way he says he learned in
      foreign parts; but Steve with his odd ways has taken his fancy, so that he
      stays on. A very well-spoken sort of person he is too, although the sea,
      it seems, has been his calling, which is a rough trade. However, he has
      made it answer&mdash;according at least to Mr Steve. Any way, he flings
      his money about free enough, and indeed is what <i>I</i> call rather too
      fond of treating folks. He is good company himself, they say, and a
      favourite with everybody he comes across, which is a very dangerous thing&mdash;that
      is,&rdquo; added Mistress Forest, correcting herself, &ldquo;unless one is a
      gentleman, like handsome Master Walter.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You don't&mdash;remember&mdash;this&mdash;this person's name, Mary, do
      you?&rdquo; asked Lady Lisgard.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;No, strange to say, I don't, my Lady; although but a moment ago it was on
      the tip of my tongue. It is something like Hathaway.&rdquo; A trace of colour
      once more returns to my Lady's cheek, and her breath, which, by reason
      perhaps of the confined space in which she stands, has seemed to be
      stifled during the narration of her maid, now comes and goes with a little
      less of effort.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;That is his voice, I reckon, my Lady&mdash;yes, I thought so&mdash;and
      the new carol which he has been teaching the choir.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      <br />
    </p>
    <p class="indent15">
      O'er the hill and o'er the vale

    </p>
    <p>
      <br />
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Ah, now I've got it, my Lady,&rdquo; cried Mistress Forest triumphantly. &ldquo;It
      isn't Hathaway. He's the man they were talking of in the servants-hall as
      has just bought the windmill of old Daniels, and that was how I confused
      them. The stranger's name is Derrick&mdash;a Mr Derrick.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      My Lady's dimpled hand flew to her heart, and would have pressed against
      it had she had any strength to do so. Her limbs, however, were nerveless,
      and shook as if she had the ague. But for the window-seat, she must have
      dropped; and as it was, leaned, huddled up against it, a shapeless form,
      decked in gray satin and pearls indeed, but as unlike my Lady as those
      poor wretches whom we strangle for a show are unlike themselves, who seem
      to lose, the instant that the fatal bolt is drawn, all fellowship with the
      human, and become mere bundles of clothes. The drop had fallen, and
      without warning, from under Lady Lisgard's feet, but unhappily the victim
      was conscious, and not dead.

    <p class="pfirst">
      <span class="dropcap" style="font-size: 4.00em">I</span>GNORANT of the
      ruin it had wrought, the rich full voice of the stranger still rang forth,
      manifestly to the admiration of the confidential maid, since her nimble
      tongue failed to interrupt its melody. She was not displeased that her
      lady too was listening with such unbroken attention, and probably also
      looking out upon the singer; for Mr Derrick was a very &ldquo;proper man&rdquo;&mdash;at
      all events in external appearance&mdash;and had shewn himself in the
      servants-hall a while ago by no means unconscious of the personal charms
      of Mistress Forest, which, although mature, were still by no means
      despicable. A few years younger than my Lady herself, Mary had been
      treated by Time at least with equal courtesy; her figure was plump, her
      eyes were bright, her voice, which, if not absolutely musical, could reach
      some very high notes, and upon occasion, was clear and cheery. One would
      have said she would have been too talkative to have suited my Lady's grave
      and quiet ways; but this was not so. Lady Lisgard had that blessed gift of
      being able not to listen unless it pleased her to do so, which enables so
      many conscientious persons to speak favourably of sermons; all the
      avalanche of her maid's eloquence passed clean over her head, and suffered
      her to pursue her own meditations at the easy tribute of an appreciating
      nod when all was ended. Even had she been much more inconvenienced by the
      <i>debris</i> of words, her tormentor would have been freely forgiven. The
      affection between mistress and maid was deep and genuine, and had extended
      over more than half their lifetime.
    </p>
    <p>
      Mary Forest was the daughter of a fisherman at Coveton, the village on
      whose sandy beach Sir Robert had picked up his bride. To old Jacob
      Forest's cottage, the human flotsam and jetsam had been conveyed, and upon
      Mary, then almost a child, had much of its tending at first devolved. The
      kindly little nurse soon won the regard of her patient, cut off by that
      one night's storm from kith and kin, for this emigrant ship had contained
      all that were near or dear to her on earth, and ready as a babe to clasp
      the tendrils of love about whoever shewed her kindness. Removed from the
      cottage to the rectory, where the clergyman and his wife welcomed her very
      hospitably, first, as a poor human waif, that claimed some lodgment ere
      she could decide upon her future calling, for a short time after that as
      their nursery governess, and finally as guest and inmate pending those
      arrangements of her betrothed husband which subsequently took her to
      France, Lucy Gavestone&mdash;for that was the name by which my Lady was
      then known&mdash;did not forget little Mary and her loving ministrations.
      She asked and easily obtained permission of Sir Robert that the girl
      should accompany her to the semi-scholastic establishment at Dijon in
      which he had decided to place her previous to their marriage. This she
      accordingly did; and many a strange reminiscence unshared by others
      (itself a great knitter of the bond of friendship) had mistress and maid
      in common. The fortunes of the latter of course rose with those of the
      former, and of all the household at Mirk Abbey there was none in higher
      trust than Mary Forest, nor more certain of the envied position she held,
      since the affection of my Lady set her above the machinations of that
      Nemesis of favourite servants, a Domestic Cabal. Those natural enemies, the
      butler and the cook, had even shaken hands together for the purpose of
      compassing Mary's downfall, but their combined endeavours had only
      obtained for a reward her sovereign forgiveness and (I am afraid I must
      add) contempt.
    </p>
    <p>
      In a word, Mary Forest was as happy in her circumstances as any woman at
      her time of life could expect to be whose title of &ldquo;Mistress&rdquo; was only
      brevet rank. She had subjugated many other male folks beside the butler
      (the ancient coachman, for example, with the back view of whose broad
      shoulders and no neck the Lisgard family had been familiar for half a
      century), but such victories had not at all been owing to her charms. By
      them, hitherto, Man had been an unconquered animal, and this was the knot
      in the otherwise smooth surface of Mary's destiny which no amount of
      planing (within <i>her</i> philosophy) could make even. She had been
      wooed, of course (what woman of twoscore, according to her own account,
      has not?), but hitherto the suitors had not been eligible, or her own
      ideas had been too ambitious. The time had now arrived with her when
      compromise begins to be expedient, and high expectations abate.
      Matrimonial opportunities at the Abbey were few and far between. She had
      not received such marked attention from anybody for months as this
      stranger, living upon his own means at the <i>Lisgard Arms</i>, had paid
      her that very night in the servants-hall. No wonder, then, that while he
      sang, she should for once be content to be a listener.

      Love makes all things pleasant.
    </p>
    <p>
      <br />
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;There, now, I call that very pretty, my Lady,&rdquo; exclaimed Mistress Forest,
      as the last cadence died away; &ldquo;and a very pretty sentiment at the end&mdash;'Love
      makes all things pleasant;' although, for my part, I know nothing about <i>that</i>,
      thank Heaven, and prefer to be my own mistress&mdash;that is, with the
      exception of your Ladyship, to obey whom is a labour of love. I am sure
      there are few husbands for whom I would give up such a service as yours,
      my Lady. I wish Mr What's-his-name&mdash;dear me, how stupid of me&mdash;ah,
      Derrick! It's rather a pretty name too; don't you think so, my Lady? I
      wish this Mr Derrick would sing us another song. He has a very beautiful
      voice, and I am sure his expression&mdash;don't you think so, my Lady?
      Ahem. No; I hear them moving off. Well, he will be in the choir to-morrow
      morning, that's sure. Had you not better come to the fire, my&mdash;&mdash;
      Ah, great Heaven! Mistress, my dear darling mistress, what is the matter?
      Let me ring for help!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      It was impossible to misunderstand my Lady's &ldquo;No,&rdquo; although it was not
      articulate.
    </p>
    <p>
      Huddled up, as I have said, in the space between the curtain and the
      window-seat, white and cold as the snow without, voiceless and almost
      breathless as her maid found her upon venturing to draw aside the heavy
      damask folds between them, such a look of agonised apprehension yet shot
      from her eyes as at once to prevent Mistress Forest from putting her
      design with respect to the bell into effect; nay, more, having assisted my
      Lady to the sofa, she rightly interpreted a second glance in the direction
      of the door, to mean &ldquo;Lock it,&rdquo; and this she did even before arranging the
      cushions, which would have been the first action with most persons of her
      class. Mary Forest, although a babbler, was no fool, and she perceived
      immediately that the distress which was agitating her beloved mistress was
      at least as much mental as physical. Once before, and only once, she had
      known my Lady to be what females call &ldquo;overcome&rdquo;&mdash;that was upon the
      eve of her marriage with Sir Robert; there was much similarity between the
      two attacks, but the present was far more violent. In the first instance,
      she had been told by her Ladyship that it was owing to &ldquo;the heart,&rdquo; which
      was fitting enough under her then circumstances&mdash;but now when there
      was no bridegroom-expectant to flutter that organ, it did seem singular
      certainly. Doubtless her mistress would speak presently, and afford the
      fullest information; in the meantime there was nothing for it but silence
      and sal volatile.
    </p>
    <p>
      My Lady's eyes are closed, and her features pale and still as marble, but
      her lips are a little parted. With her white hands thus crosswise over her
      bosom, she looks, thinks the confidential maid&mdash;for all the world
      like that Dame Lisgard in the chancel, by the side of whose marble couch
      her twelve fair children kneel, and take their mother's ceaseless
      blessing. All twelve so near of an age, and so marvellously alike, thanks
      to the skill of the sculptor, that one would have thought the whole dozen&mdash;but
      that four, as Mistress Forest has read in <i>Portents and Prodigies</i>,
      is the extreme limit&mdash;had made their simultaneous arrival in the
      world. Stiff and cold almost as marble are my Lady's limbs, blue-veined
      like it and rounded; but by degrees, as Mary rubs them steadily, their
      life returns.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Thank you, thank you,&rdquo; murmurs her Ladyship. &ldquo;I feel better now; but&rdquo;
       (this with effort) &ldquo;I wish to be left alone.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Alone, my Lady! I dare not leave you thus, without even knowing what ails
      you.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Nothing ails me now, Mary&mdash;nothing.&rdquo; Lady Lisgard made a feint of
      smiling, but kept her eyelids shut. She did not dare to let her maid read
      what was written in her eyes.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Was it your poor heart, again, madam?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Ay, my poor heart!&rdquo; My Lady was speaking truth there. Among the thousand
      millions born to suffer on this earth, there was not one upon that
      Christmas Eve in mental agony more deep than hers. The blow received had
      been so terrible and unexpected, that it had at first half stupified all
      feeling; the real torture was now commencing, when she was about to
      realise the full extent of her injuries. Lady Lisgard was not without
      courage; but she was no Indian warrior to desire a spectator of such
      torments. &ldquo;I must be alone, dear Mary,&rdquo; repeated she. &ldquo;Be sure you breathe
      no word of this to any one. Say, however, that I am not very well. The
      cold when I opened that window to the Waits&rdquo;&mdash;here she visibly
      shuddered&mdash;&ldquo;seems to have frozen me to the marrow&mdash;you may tell
      them I have taken cold. I shall not be down to breakfast.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;And I should recommend you to stay indoors, my dear (as I hope to
      persuade Miss Letty to do), although it <i>is</i> Christmas Day,&rdquo; said
      Mary tenderly, as she made up the fire before leaving the room; &ldquo;for the
      church is far from warm.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I shall not go to church,&rdquo; said Lady Lisgard, with a decision that
      reassured her attendant, and enabled her to wish her mistress &ldquo;good-night&rdquo;
       without much apprehension.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;He will be in the choir to-morrow morning,&rdquo; was the thought which was
      crossing the minds of mistress and maid at the same instant.

    <h2>
      CHAPTER IV. SIR RICHARD GAINS HIS POINT.
    </h2>
    <p class="pfirst">
      <span class="dropcap" style="font-size: 4.00em">I</span> DON'T know how it
      was in the Monkish times in England, but it appears that the keeping of
      religious days&mdash;always excepting the Sabbath&mdash;is not in
      accordance with the genius of this country as it exists at present. By
      general habit, we are devout, or certainly reverent; and yet the majority
      seem unable to discriminate between a fast and a festival. Christmas Day,
      for example, is kept by the evangelical folks exactly like Sunday, which
      is with them very much the reverse of a feast-day. With the High Church
      people, again, it is a Holiday, to be enjoyed after a certain peculiar
      fashion of their own; while the great mass of the population outrage both
      these parties by treating half the day as a fast and the other half as a
      festival. After morning church, it is generally understood that one may
      enjoy one's self&mdash;that is, within the limit of the domestic circle.
      There is the rub. It is not every disposition which can appreciate
      forfeits and snap-dragon. My own respected grandfather used to thank
      Heaven with much devotion that he had always been a domestic man, who knew
      how to enjoy a peaceful Christmas in the bosom of his family; but then he
      always went to sleep immediately after dinner, and nobody ventured to wake
      him until the servants came in to prayers, after which he went to bed.
    </p>
    <p>
      It is a pleasant sight, says Holy Writ, to see brethren dwelling together
      in unity; but the remark would not have been put on record had the
      spectacle been a very common one. It is a sad confession to make, but I
      think most of us must own that the &ldquo;family gathering&rdquo; in the country, even
      at Christmas-tide, is not the most agreeable sort of social entertainment.
      There is too much predetermination to be jolly about such festivities, too
      much resolution to put up with Polly's temper and Jack's rudeness, and to
      please grandpapa (who is funded) at all hazards. When we find ourselves in
      the up-train again after that domestic holiday-week, we are not altogether
      displeased that it is over, and secretly congratulate ourselves that there
      has not been a row. I am, of course, speaking of ordinary folks, such as
      the world is mainly composed of, and not of such exemplary people as my
      readers and myself. <i>We</i> have no family jealousies, no struggles for
      grandpapa's favour, no difficulties in having common patience with Polly,
      no private opinion&mdash;if he was not our brother&mdash;about Jack; no
      astonishment at Henry's success, no envy at Augusta's prospects. But with
      the majority of grown-up brothers and sisters, this is not so. Since they
      parted from one another under the paternal roof, their lines of life have
      diverged daily; their interests, so far from being identical, have become
      antagonistic. Margaret is as nice as ever, but Penelope is not a bit
      improved, and yet one must seem to be as glad to see one as the other. One
      must not only forgive, but forget; it is not (unhappily) necessary that we
      should be polite, but we must be affectionate; nay, we must not only be
      affectionate&mdash;grandpapa will think it extremely odd if we are not
      &ldquo;gushing.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      The Lisgard family circle was not large, though, as we have seen, there
      was room in it for disagreement; moreover, there was not a &ldquo;dead set&rdquo; of
      domestic element, the consanguinity being relieved by the presence of Miss
      Rose Aynton. If grandpapa were wise, this should always be the case; for
      it prevents Courtesy from taking leave of the company, which she is only
      too apt to do, under the mistaken notion that near relations can afford to
      do without her. It was with no such intention, however, that my Lady had
      asked Miss Aynton to visit Mirk. She would have thought it hard, indeed,
      if her two sons could not have spent a week together under the same roof
      without the presence of a stranger to prevent their quarrelling. Rose had
      been a school-friend of Letty, and the latter young lady had asked
      permission to invite her young friend to the Abbey for Christmas. She had
      no home of her own to go to, poor thing, having neither father nor mother.
      She lived with her aunt, Miss Colyfield, a fashionable old lady in
      Mayfair, very popular among her acquaintance, but a sort of person, not
      uncommon in that locality, whom it is not altogether charming to reside
      with as a dependent. Miss Aynton was evidently accustomed to suppression.
      It made a man positively indignant to see one whose youth and intelligence
      entitled her to be the mistress of all who approached her, so humble, so
      unegotistic, so grateful. It was evident that she had plenty of natural
      good spirits, and every faculty for enjoyment, if she had only dared
      exhibit them. Her very accomplishments, which were numerous, were timidly
      concealed, and peeped forth one by one, almost, as it seemed, by
      compulsion. She might have left Mirk, for instance, without a soul knowing
      of her taste for ecclesiastical decoration, if it had not been for a sore
      throat which prevented Letty from superintending the Christmas
      ornamentations in the chancel.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Can't <i>you</i> do it, my dear?&rdquo; said Letty, a little peevish at the
      disappointment, and hopeless that her place could be satisfactorily filled
      by a London-bred girl like Rose, who had never seen holly-berries except
      in the greengrocers' shops, or at the artificial florist's. &ldquo;Now, do try,
      and Richard and Walter will both help.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I will do my best, dear,&rdquo; this young lady had answered simply. And never
      had anything so beautiful been seen in the county, as was the result of
      her efforts. So much was said of them that Letty had ventured to go to
      church that morning, despite her ailment, and was as earnest in her praise
      as any in the congregation. There was no such thing as jealousy in her
      composition, and the success of her friend was a genuine pleasure to her.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;O mamma, you have missed such a sight!&rdquo; cried she, as Lady Lisgard made
      her first appearance that morning at the luncheon-table, looking a little
      grave and pale, but gracious and dignified as a queen in exile, as usual.
      &ldquo;Not only the chancel, but the whole church a perfect bower of evergreens,
      and everything so exquisitely done! The pillars, alternately ivy and
      laurel; and under the gallery, beautiful texts in holly-berries set in
      green. As for the wall at the back of the altar&mdash;the decorations
      there are such that it makes one cry to think they are ever to be taken
      down again. Oh, I do hope you will feel well enough, dear mamma, to come
      to church this afternoon and see them.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Really, Lady Lisgard,&rdquo; said Miss Aynton, blushing deeply, and with her
      soft eyes looking very much inclined to be tearful, &ldquo;you must not believe
      all that Lefty's kindness induces her to say about me.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Nay, but it's true, mother,&rdquo; broke forth Sir Richard. &ldquo;I never could have
      dreamt of anything so beautiful being made out of leaves and berries. The
      old church looks enchanted, and Miss Aynton is the fairy that has done
      it.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Sir Richard suggested the centre design himself,&rdquo; returned Rose gravely;
      &ldquo;and the fact is, I am nothing but a plagiarist in the whole affair. Our
      curate in Park Street gives himself up to floral religion, and dresses up
      his church in a dozen different garbs according to the season. I am one of
      its volunteer tiring-women, and am therefore accustomed to the business&mdash;that
      is all.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;It is very honest of you to tell us that, Rose,&rdquo; said my Lady
      approvingly.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes, mamma,&rdquo; broke in Letty; &ldquo;but it was very wicked of her not to tell
      Mr Mosely, who came to thank her in the churchyard after service. He
      actually made an allusion to her in his sermon&mdash;talked about her
      'pious hands.' She never told him one word about this London curate.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Letty's laugh rang merrily out as she thus twitted her friend, but her
      brothers did not echo it. Neither of them relished this mention of the
      Mayfair clergyman. They had each in turn enjoyed that religious work, in
      which they had been fellow-labourers with Miss Aynton, and each perhaps
      flattered himself that she had been most pleased when his own fingers were
      looping the berries for her, or holding the ivy while she fastened it in
      its place. Of course there was nothing serious between either of them and
      herself. Sir Richard would naturally look higher for a bride than to the
      dependent niece of a fickle old woman of fashion; while as to Walter, with
      his comparatively small fortune and expensive tastes, it was absolutely
      necessary that he should &ldquo;marry money,&rdquo; and not mere expectations. Still,
      no man is altogether pleased to hear that a young girl he admires is
      engaged to somebody else; and although this had not been said of Rose, yet
      Mayfair curates are dangerous persons, and church decoration (as they were
      aware by recent experience) is a fascinating occupation when indulged in
      by both sexes at the same time.
    </p>
    <p>
      So Letty had all the laughter to herself.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;How strange it was to hear the people when they first came in,&rdquo; continued
      she. &ldquo;Their 'Ohs!' and Ahhs!' and 'Well I nevers!' were quite
      irrepressible.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Especially the gentleman in the gallery, who expressed his opinion that
      it was for all the world like May-day,&rdquo; observed Walter slily. &ldquo;Miss
      Aynton's <i>chef-d'oeuvre</i> reminded him, it seems, of
      Jack-in-the-Green.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes, was it not shocking, mamma?&rdquo; exclaimed Letty. &ldquo;He spoke quite loud.
      I shouldn't suppose that the creature had ever been in a church before.
      How he did stare about him!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You must have been looking in his direction yourself, miss,&rdquo; returned the
      young dragoon, &ldquo;as, indeed, were all the female part of the congregation.
      We don't see such awful beards as his in Mirk church every Sunday.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;How touchy dear Walter is upon the subject of beards,&rdquo; observed Letty
      demurely.
    </p>
    <p>
      The captain's smooth face coloured like a girl's, while Miss Rose Aynton
      sought concealment in her pocket-handkerchief. Even Lady Lisgard forced
      herself to smile at the embarrassment of her handsome boy. But Sir Richard
      did not smile; he was not on sufficiently good terms with his younger
      brother to enjoy even so innocent a joke at his expense.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You have not yet seen this distinguished stranger, I suppose, mamma?&rdquo;
       resumed Letty, without whom&mdash;what with Rose's shyness and the
      coldness between the two young men&mdash;the conversation would have
      languished altogether.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;What stranger do you mean, my dear?&rdquo; said my Lady coldly.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Why, the man that came with the Waits last night, and sang beneath your
      window. Surely you must have noticed his voice, so different from poor old
      Ash and the rest of them.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Now you mention it, Letty, I think I did remark that there was a strange
      singer among them. He had a voice like Mr Steve's.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Very probably, my dear mother,&rdquo; observed Walter laughing; &ldquo;for they both
      use the same tuning-key&mdash;the Spigot. Steve is said to be quite
      jealous because this gentleman from foreign parts can take two glasses to
      his one, although it cannot be added that he doesn't shew it. Steve can
      look like a Methodist parson when he pleases, whereas his new friend has
      made a sacrifice of his very countenance to Bacchus; and yet he must have
      been a handsome fellow at one time.&mdash;Don't you think so, Miss
      Aynton?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I really scarcely looked at him,&rdquo; returned the young lady addressed. &ldquo;I
      should hesitate to pass an opinion upon this distinguished&mdash;&mdash;&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;O Rose,&rdquo; interrupted Letty archly; &ldquo;how dare you!&mdash;Why, Walter, she
      told me herself, only five minutes ago, while we were taking off our
      bonnets, that she thought his expression 'magnificent '&mdash;that was her
      very word&mdash;and that she would like to take him in chalks.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I must confess,&rdquo; said Rose, &ldquo;without venturing to call it good-looking or
      otherwise, that his countenance, artistically speaking, seems to me very
      striking. He is just one of those wicked people, I fancy, in whom one
      feels a sort of interest in spite of one's self.&mdash;Now, don't you
      think so, Sir Richard?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;My dear Miss Aynton,&rdquo; returned the baronet with an air of hauteur that
      neutralised the familiarity implied by his words, &ldquo;if this person has won
      your sympathy, he is fortunate indeed; but I must say that I don't see
      that he deserves it. His beard, which is certainly a handsome one, has
      also&mdash;as it seems to me&mdash;the great advantage of obscuring half
      his countenance. I confess, I think he looks to be a scoundrel of the
      first salt-water.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;That's what Rose <i>means!</i>&rdquo; cried Letty, clapping her hands. &ldquo;He's
      one of those dear handsome villains who used to&mdash;ah, infest&mdash;yes,
      that's the phrase&mdash;who used to infest the Spanish Main. How
      charmingly mysterious was the very place in which they carried on their
      profession! If it was not for seasickness, I should like to have had
      something to do in the Spanish Main myself. I have not the shadow of a
      doubt that this Mr Derrick&mdash;evidently an assumed name&mdash;&mdash;
      What's the matter, dearest mother?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      My Lady had uttered a low cry, such as is evoked by sudden and acute
      physical pain.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Nothing, my love&mdash;nothing: it was a passing spasm, nothing more. A
      tinge of my old rheumatism again, I fear, which is a sign of old age, and
      therefore a malady I do not wish to be taken notice of.&mdash;Now, don't
      distress yourselves, my dears&rdquo;&mdash;for all had risen with looks of
      genuine and affectionate anxiety, except Miss Aynton, who had rapidly
      poured out a glass of wine.&mdash;&ldquo;Thank you, Rose; that was all I wanted.
      Nobody offered me any sherry, so I thought I would try whether I could not
      obtain it medicinally.&mdash;What were you saying, Letty, about this&mdash;this
      person?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I was merely remarking that he had probably been a buccaneer, mamma.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;In other words, that he deserves hanging,&rdquo; observed Sir Richard gruffly.
      &ldquo;I hope he will soon take himself out of the parish, for we have got
      tipplers enough in it already.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Dear, dear, dear!&rdquo; said Letty sedately; &ldquo;to make such an observation as
      that, just after mamma has been craving for sherry! Besides, how can this
      gentleman annoy <i>you</i>, Sir Richard? He isn't come here to dispute the
      title, is he?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      My Lady kept her lips closed this time; but an anguish passed over her
      face that would have been easy to see, had not the eyes of those at table
      been otherwise engaged.
    </p>
    <p>
      Letty was looking at her friend, in hopes that she should get her to laugh
      at her high and mighty brother; Rose did not dare look up, for fear she
      should do so. Walter, his handsome lips slightly curled, was
      contemptuously watching the baronet, who stared, Sphinx-like, right before
      him, as was his custom whenever he was in one of his autocratic humours,
      as at present.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I don't choose to have persons of that sort in the parish,&rdquo; said he with
      icy distinctness.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;But, my dear Richard, you can't turn him out,&rdquo; reasoned Letty, rather
      vexed by an exhibition of her brother's pride before her school-friend
      beyond what she had calculated upon. &ldquo;He has a right to stop at the <i>Lisgard
      Arms</i> as long as he pleases.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;And <i>I</i> have a right to turn Steve out as a tenant&rdquo;&mdash;&mdash;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You have nothing of the kind, Richard,&rdquo; interposed Walter quietly; &ldquo;you
      have no more right than I&mdash;not even legal right, for the inn is not
      yet yours, and as for moral right, it would be the most monstrous piece of
      territorial oppression ever heard of out of Poland. So long as the man
      behaves himself&rdquo;&mdash;&mdash;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;He does <i>not</i> behave himself,&rdquo; put in Sir Richard angrily. &ldquo;He is a
      drunkard, and a brawler in church.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Gracious mercy! how you must have been looking up Burn's <i>Justice</i>.
      But you will not be a magistrate, a <i>custos rotulorum</i>, till you are
      of age, remember, so that he is safe for six months. In the meantime, he
      certainly means to stay here. He is so good as to say he likes Mirk, I
      understand; and the village folks like <i>him</i>. He is a great addition
      to the choir; and I shall certainly ask him, in case he remains, to join
      our Mirk volunteers: Steve tells me he is a most admirable shot with a
      rifle, and will do the corps credit.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;That is all the worse,&rdquo; quoth Sir Richard violently; &ldquo;he is only the more
      likely to be a poacher. We have more than enough of that sort already, and
      I beg that you will give none such your encouragement.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Encouragement!&rdquo; returned Walter airily. &ldquo;What patronage have <i>I</i> to
      offer? I am not Sir Richard, who can make a man happy with a word.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Very well,&rdquo; continued the baronet with suppressed passion, &ldquo;let him take
      care how he trespasses upon the Abbey-lands&mdash;that's all.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Nay, you'll see him at the Abbey itself,&rdquo; laughed Walter carelessly, &ldquo;and
      that pretty often, unless I quite misinterpreted Mistress Forest's manner
      when she parted from him at the Lych Gate: I never saw two people more
      affectionate upon so short an acquaintance.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;A most ineligible suitor, I am sure,&rdquo; broke forth the baronet. &ldquo;I trust
      Mary is not fool enough to disgrace herself at her time of life by any
      such alliance.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;She is almost old enough to choose for herself,&rdquo; responded Walter drily.
      &ldquo;The selection of a husband for one's servant is scarcely the privilege of
      even a lord of the manor, and when the servant is not one's own&rdquo;&mdash;&mdash;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I believe, sir,&rdquo; interrupted Sir Richard hastily, &ldquo;that I am only
      speaking the sentiments of her mistress, in whose hands, of course, the
      matter lies.&mdash;Mother, do you not agree with me that it would be very
      unwise to encourage any attachment between Mary Forest and this reprobate
      stranger, Derrick?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      It was plain my Lady had not recovered from her late ailment, of whatever
      nature the attack might have been; otherwise, she would have interfered
      between the brothers before a direct appeal for her decision had been made
      by either of them, it being a rule with her never to place herself in an
      invidious position with respect to her children. To the astonishment of
      the baronet himself, however, Lady Lisgard now forced her pale lips to
      utter deliberately enough: &ldquo;I think it would be very unwise.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;And therefore,&rdquo; pursued Sir Richard, hastening to push his advantage, &ldquo;it
      would be worse than unwise, it would be absolute cruelty, since you do not
      intend her to marry this fellow, that opportunities should be afforded her
      of meeting him under the same roof. I do not say that his offence of
      brawling in church this morning is a sufficient ground of itself for
      forbidding him the house, although to most persons with any sense of
      decency it would be a serious misdemeanour: but would it not be well,
      under these particular circumstances, to treat it so?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes,&rdquo; returned my Lady, rising from the table, white as a ghost, &ldquo;you are
      right, Richard; let this Mr Derrick be forbidden the house.&rdquo;
     </p>

      CHAPTER V. MASTER WALTER.
    </h2>
    <p class="pfirst">
      <span class="dropcap" style="font-size: 4.00em">T</span>HE day after
      Christmas Day was friendly to the fox; in other words, a hard frost; and
      since Miss Rose Aynton and Letty had declined to play at billiards with
      Walter until the afternoon&mdash;for it is vicious (in the country) to
      indulge in that pastime in the morning, as it is to play at cards before
      candle-light&mdash;that young gentleman, being no reader, felt the time
      rather heavy on his hands, and strolled into the village to get rid of it.
      The snow had ceased to fall, but not before, like a good housekeeper when
      the family has left town, it had covered up everything very carefully,
      except the tops of the chimneys, through which the tidings of good-cheer
      rolled forth in dusky columns from every cottage; for there were no abject
      poor in Mirk, thanks to my Lady, or any that lacked victuals at that
      joyous season.
    </p>
    <p>
      The Lisgards had ever been a free-handed race, as generous out of doors as
      hospitable within; and their influence for good had been felt for
      generations throughout the village. I do not say that they expected no
      repayment; their rule was paternal, and they looked for something like
      filial obedience in return. If a villager had passed any member of that
      august family without pulling his hair, as though it were a bell-handle,
      in token of respect, it would have been considered a sign of revolution,
      and they would have congratulated themselves that the yeomanry were in a
      state of efficiency. The feudal system was still in vogue at Mirk, but
      tempered not only by excellent beef-tea in sickness, and port wine from
      the Abbey cellar during convalescence, but by the best Gothic
      architecture, as applied to cottages. If eleven human beings did sometimes
      sleep in a single room, and the domestic arrangements were inferior to
      those which Mr Chifney of the Farm provided for his race-horses, the
      tenement looked outside very picturesque, as seen from the Abbey windows.
      Nay, it must be owned that even this inconvenience of overcrowding was
      rare in the home-village, in comparison with other places on the Lisgard
      estate, not so near the family seat, about which everything was in
      externals, at least, becomingly spick and span.
    </p>
    <p>
      Dr Haldane, indeed, who had property of his own, and could afford to
      entertain political opinions at variance with those in favour at the
      Abbey, had been of old accustomed irreverently to adapt a certain popular
      nursery ballad to the state of things at Mirk.
    </p>
    <p>
      <br />
    </p>
    <p class="indent15">
      Who built the infant school so red?
    </p>
    <p class="indent15">
      Who set that striking-clock o'erhead,

    <p>
      In short, Mirk was a pet hamlet, and exhibited a hundred tokens of its
      patron's favour. It was surely only right and proper, therefore, that all
      the votes in the village at election-time, except the doctor's, went the
      same way with the squire's, and that even in social matters he exercised
      unquestioned sway. Mirk was as respectable as the brotherhood of Quakers,
      and was rendered so by the same simple machinery; any one in the place who
      shewed a disposition to be otherwise was immediately turned out. Did a man
      drink, so as to cause public disturbance, or pick up sticks (to save
      himself trouble) out of the park-fences&mdash;or, worse than all, did he
      Poach&mdash;were it but a pheasant's egg&mdash;he received the most
      peremptory notice to quit the model village. The issuing of these ukases
      of banishment had been, now and then, a severe trial to the popularity of
      the Lisgards; but it had overlived all such acts&mdash;nay, more, even its
      favouritism, that seemingly indispensable element of the feudal system,
      had been forgiven it. Nobody now complained that George Steve, who
      notoriously never went to bed quite sober, still continued tenant of the
      <i>Lisgard Arms</i>; while Jacob Flail and Joseph Dibble had been
      condemned, with their families, to banishment for life for a less habitual
      commission of the same offence.
    </p>
    <p>
      Much less did it strike the villagers that it was inconsistent in a
      landlord, so careful for the morality of his people, to let so large a
      portion of the Abbey Farm to a trainer of race-horses, of which there were
      at present upwards of thirty in Mirk; and in summer, when the Downland
      above was fit for their exercise, there were often twice as many. But then
      Mr Chifney was not like an ordinary trainer; nor did his jockey-boys,
      thanks to his strict supervision, behave like ordinary jockey-boys. They
      attended divine service on alternate Sundays, and half-a-dozen of them
      were in the choir. Mr Mosely (who was Anglican) had even taken into
      consideration the advisability of putting these last into surplices, but
      Mr Chifney had dissuaded him from that experiment. They had always been
      accustomed to the most tight-fitting of garments, strait-waistcoats,
      buck-skin breeches, and gaiters&mdash;and perhaps he thought the
      transition would be too abrupt. Their habits, in some other respects, were
      loose, and yet they were suffered to breathe the Lisgard air. Mr Chifney's
      boys were like the servants of ambassadors at foreign courts, who enjoy a
      separate jurisdiction from that to which the native inhabitants submit.
      The law itself&mdash;at least in the case of petty offences&mdash;was not
      called in to punish these young gentlemen; but I believe they were
      &ldquo;colted&rdquo;&mdash;for the whole discipline was &ldquo;horsey&rdquo;&mdash;by Mr Chifney's
      head-groom. I do not know the exact manner in which this chastisement was
      inflicted, but it must have differed from the ordinary method, since they
      never failed to pursue their daily equestrian duties as usual. Mr Chifney
      looked after that himself, and exceedingly sharp. Nothing went amiss
      through oversight in his establishment, and his employers had every reason
      to put confidence in him. He left no means untried to insure the success
      of the costly animals it was his mission to groom and guard. His very
      acceptance of the post of churchwarden had been described by his enemies
      as an attempt to &ldquo;hedge&rdquo;&mdash;to make friends with those powers of good
      which are generally supposed, to be antagonistic, if they have anything to
      do with it at all, to the profession of horse-racing. It is certain that
      Mr Chifney, whose occupations seldom permitted his own attendance at
      public worship, never failed to come to church upon those Sundays which
      immediately preceded the Derby and the St Leger, and indeed it is very
      likely that he treated them (without knowing it) as the eves of his patron
      saints' days.
    </p>
    <p>
      It was to the Abbey Farm that Mr Walter Lisgard was now bound; for to the
      young gentlemen of England, what is a more interesting spectacle than a
      racing-stable&mdash;what is a more charming subject of conversation than
      the next Great Event? And who more fitted to afford every information upon
      that important topic&mdash;if he chose&mdash;than Mr Tite Chifney? <i>If
      he chose</i>. Therein lay the whole matter; for Mr Chifney was reticent,
      as became one intrusted with a hundred thousand pounds' worth of
      horseflesh, upon whose performances depended perhaps, in the aggregate,
      millions of money. He had put &ldquo;Master Walter&rdquo; up to a &ldquo;good thing,&rdquo;
       however, more than once, and the captain had no doubt but that he would do
      it again. He never did doubt of his own success either with man or woman.
      Confidence, but without swagger, self-content, but without vanity, were
      evident enough in those handsome features, illuminated almost at all times
      with the desire to please. He lit his cigar at the hall-door, smoothed
      away a fallen spark from his sealskin waistcoat, and took his way down the
      leafless avenue, humming the latest lively air, as he crunched the snow
      beneath his dainty boots. How different from Sir Richard's measured step
      and haughty silence, thought the gatekeeper's wife, as she hastened out of
      the lodge, from the side-window of which she had marked her favourite
      approach. &ldquo;Never mind me, Martha,&rdquo; cried he laughing; &ldquo;I'm tall enough now
      to lift the latch for myself. My boots are thicker than yours are&mdash;look&mdash;and
      I have no rheumatism, which, I am afraid, you have not quite got rid of
      yet. There&mdash;I won't speak a word with you till you go inside. How's
      the guidman? Ah, out, is he? How's little Polly? Hullo, Polly, how you're
      grown! Why, I daresay she won't kiss me now, as she always used to do.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh yes, she'll kiss you, Master Walter,&rdquo; answered the old dame; &ldquo;there's
      no harm in kissing o' <i>you</i>; although I wouldn't say that to my
      daughter of ne'er another young man in the county.&mdash;Come, lass, you
      need not blush so, for I've had many a one from the same young gentleman.&rdquo;
       And the old dame laughed and chuckled, until that dread enemy of
      honest-hearted mirth, the lumbago, twitched her into her chair.
    </p>
    <p>
      Polly, a very pretty country lassie, about sixteen, stood pink and
      hesitating while the captain removed his cigar, and waited&mdash;smiling
      demigod&mdash;for the promised favour.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Come, gi'e it to him, and ha' done wi' it,&rdquo; cried the old lady,
      exasperated by her torments. Thereupon the girl stepped forward, head
      aside. Master Walter met her, touched her soft cheek with his lip, and as
      his silken moustache brushed her ear, whispered an airy something which
      turned her crimson. There was nothing in the words themselves save the
      merest compliment; their magic lay in the tone of him who used them; so
      tender, yet so frank, so familiar, and yet so gracious. Then, with a
      smile, he bade them both &ldquo;good-bye,&rdquo; and strolling through the gate,
      resumed his interrupted ditty, as though kissing were the most innocent as
      well as the most natural of all pastimes; but Polly pressed her throbbing
      brow against the pane for its very coolness, and watched him saunter down
      the village street with quite a flutter at her heart, and promised to
      herself that she would not forget the captain's kiss&mdash;no, not though
      Joe, the under-gardener, should speak his mind next &ldquo;feast&rdquo; (as it was
      rumoured in well-informed circles that he intended to do), and &ldquo;keep her
      company&rdquo; in earnest.
    </p>
    <p>
      That she was doing no wrong in this was certain, for not only her mother,
      but everybody else in Mirk, agreed that there was no sort of harm in
      Master Walter, let him do what he might. He had a way of doing things so
      very different from others. How the very dogs fawned upon him as he
      sauntered on, and the old horse in the straw-yard stretched its gray head
      over the gate in hopes of a caress as he went by! How the boys by the
      roadside left their Snow-man an unfinished torso, and ran to make their
      bows before the good-natured captain, with an eye to <i>largesse</i>, in
      the form of a copper scramble; and how the school-girls courtesied, with
      admiring awe, as they pictured to themselves how fine a figure handsome
      Master Walter must needs cut in gold and scarlet! He had a nod or a word
      for almost everybody, young or old; but if his look but lit upon another's
      face, it left a pleasure there, as the Sun leaves when it has shone upon
      one. Delayed by these reciprocal manifestations of good-will, like a young
      prince making a Royal Progress among a well-affected people, Walter
      Lisgard at length got free of the village, and climbing a steep hill
      (never used by the race-horses even in much less slippery weather),
      arrived at his destination, the Abbey Farm. This was a long, low, ancient
      building, belonging to one could scarce tell what date, so pieced, and
      restored, and added to, had been the original structure; but when the
      Abbey was an Abbey, the Abbey Farm had been a sort of
      branch-establishment, in the occupation of the monks; there were traces of
      their sojourn even now: over the pointed porch yet stood a cross of stone,
      though broken; and in the garden, now all white and hoar, that lay between
      the house and road, there was a mighty sundial, carved like a font with
      noseless saints in niches, and round the rim a scripture, of which alone
      the words <i>nox venit</i> could be deciphered. The night <i>had</i> come,
      not only upon those who built and blessed such things, but on the faith
      which they professed. The very memory of themselves and it had faded from
      men's minds. Not one in ten at Mirk&mdash;where all had owned the Abbot
      for liege-lord, and bowed their heads before his meanest monk, in token of
      their soul's humility, but a few centuries back&mdash;not one in ten, I
      say, could tell even what that niche on the south side of the
      communion-table meant, which the learned called <i>Piscina</i>. The mighty
      bower that had once been the granary of the Abbey, and to which the poor
      had looked with thankful eyes in times of scarcity, still stood beside the
      homestead, but the remembrance of its very use was gone; the only legend
      clinging to its moss-grown walls was that a Long Parliament had once held
      its sittings there. Save the farmhouse and the barn, all relics of the
      past had been swept away. Immediately behind them was quite a town of
      stables and loose boxes, all of the most modern construction, and
      furnished with the latest inventions for equine comfort. The enormous
      farmyard, strewn with a thick carpet of clean straw, was now the
      exercising-ground for the horses; but in the summer, a gate at the back of
      the premises opened immediately upon the grassy upland, the proximity of
      which had tempted Mr Tite Chifney to pitch his tent and enlarge his
      boundaries at the Abbey Farm. So high had been the rent he offered for
      this eligible situation, that the late Sir Robert had removed his own
      agricultural head-quarters elsewhere, and suffered Mr Chifney and his
      race-horses to occupy the whole place, which was now the capital of the
      Houwhyhims&mdash;the largest establishment in Great Britain, wherein man
      held the secondary position, and the Horse the principal.

      CHAPTER VI. THE RACING-STABLE.
    </h2>
    <p class="pfirst">
      <span class="dropcap" style="font-size: 4.00em">I</span>T was Mr Chifney
      in person who admitted Walter Lisgard, after a precautionary glance at him
      through a little grating, which doubtless the monks had used for a similar
      purpose, although without the same excuse, for they had never possessed
      any Derby &ldquo;cracks&rdquo; to be poisoned. Mr Chifney might have been himself a
      monk but for his apparel, which, although scrupulously neat and plain,
      fitted him almost like war-paint, so that there was not a crease to be
      seen, except at the knees, of which he made as much use as the holy
      fathers themselves did, though not precisely in the same way. His dark
      hair was closely cropped, and a little bald spot on the top of the crown
      might well have been taken for a tonsure. Moreover, he had a grave and
      secretive look, which would have well enough become one in whom were
      reposed the secrets of the Confessional; and when he smiled, he looked
      sorry for it immediately afterwards, as though he had given way to a
      carnal pleasure.
    </p>
    <p>
      Captain Lisgard shook the trainer's hand with his usual hearty warmth, and
      Mr Chifney returned his pressure with unwonted cordiality. He was
      accustomed to meet men of a much higher social rank than his present
      visitor on something like equal terms; many of them shook hands with him;
      all of them treated him with familiarity. The Turf, like the Grave, levels
      all distinctions. Between the Lord and the Blackleg (to make an
      antithetical use of terms that are not seldom synonymous), there is but
      slight partition on that common ground; the widest gulf of social
      difference is bridged over, <i>pro tem</i>, by the prospect of an
      advantageous bet. How much more, then, was this wont to be the case in
      view of the trustworthy &ldquo;information&rdquo; which Mr Tite Chifney had it so
      often in his power to bestow? Marquises had taken his arm in a
      confidential manner before now in the most public places, and dukes had
      called him &ldquo;Tite;&rdquo; even ladies of the highest fashion had treated him to
      pretty speeches, and to what they hoped might turn out literally &ldquo;winning
      ways.&rdquo; But the great trainer estimated all these condescensions at their
      true value. He never concealed from himself the motives that caused these
      people to be so civil to him; and perhaps he had seen too much of the
      turfite aristocracy to be flattered by their attentions, even had they
      been disinterested. But Walter Lisgard's greeting was different from those
      which he was wont to receive from his great patrons; there was not only a
      cordial frankness about it, but a something of sympathy, conveyed with
      marvellous tact, in his air and manner; which seemed to say: &ldquo;I
      unfeignedly regret that anything like friendship should be impossible
      between us, for I am your social superior; and yet, how ridiculous a thing
      it is that this should be so! I, but the younger brother of a man himself
      of no great position, and you, at the head of that profession in which the
      noblest in the land take so great and personal an interest.&rdquo; If Mr Chifney
      did not read all this, it is certain that so acute an observer could not
      fail to read some of it. He was as far from being moved by any
      considerations not strictly practical as any man connected with
      horseflesh; his calling, too, rendered him as suspicious of his
      fellow-creatures as a police detective; but Master Walter's sort of
      flattery was too subtle for him. He had always had a liking for this
      genial young fellow, with his handsome face and pleasant speech, and who,
      moreover, rode across country like a centaur; he was one of his own
      landlord's family, too, and the heir-presumptive of the property, whose
      favour it was just as well to win and keep; and lastly, the lad had been
      so unfeignedly grateful to him for the little hints he had occasionally
      afforded him, as well as so wisely reticent about his informant, that he
      was not unwilling to help him again to a few &ldquo;fivers,&rdquo; if he could do so
      without the betrayal of professional confidence.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Come for another 'tip,' eh, Master Walter?&rdquo; whispered he good-naturedly
      as he led the way into the house. &ldquo;You see I did not deceive you the last
      time you were here about <i>Cambyses!</i>&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;No, indeed, you did not, Mr Chifney&rdquo; (Walter never addressed this friend
      of his without the Mister), &ldquo;and a very great blessing it was to yours
      thankfully at a time when he was even more hard-up than usual. Is your
      Derby 'crack' visible today? I am poor, but honest. I have no motive
      beyond that of curiosity, and if suspected of a concealed weapon, will
      submit to be searched.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Well, Master Walter,&rdquo; grinned the trainer, &ldquo;I can't say that I much
      credit the honesty of anybody myself; but I don't see why you should not
      have a look at his majesty, particularly as there is one coming here this
      morning already upon the same errand, and I'm sure I'd as soon oblige you
      as him&mdash;or, indeed, as any man, let it be who it will.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You are very kind to say so, Mr Chifney, and still more to mean it, as I
      am sure you do; but I feel that I have no right with my bagatelle of a
      stake depending upon the matter to take up your time&mdash;nay, I must
      insist upon throwing my cigar away before entering your house; it is all
      very well for Mrs Chifney to give <i>you</i> the privilege of smoking
      within doors, but I could not venture to take such a liberty myself. What
      a jolly place this is of yours; I always think it is so much snugger than
      the Abbey. I should never sit anywhere but in your grand old kitchen, if I
      were you.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Well, the fact is we <i>do</i> sit a good deal in the kitchen,&rdquo; returned
      Mr Chifney reddening. &ldquo;It's warm, you see, although it's large, and my
      wife likes to see how things are going on. She's engaged there just at
      present, and&mdash;you're a great favourite of hers; but I would recommend
      you to step in as you <i>go out</i>, instead of now. A queer thing is
      woman, Master Walter, and no man can tell how queer till he comes to be
      married! Young gals is all sweetness and easily cajoled; but wives&mdash;O
      lor! Now, it's exactly different with horseflesh, for the brood-mares one
      <i>can</i> manage with a little care, and it's only the fillies that give
      us trouble, and have such tempers of their own. There; that's a Derby nag,
      <i>Blue Ruin</i>, in the cloths yonder, and I believe the Duke would not
      sell him for three thousand pounds; but I have told His Grace, as I tell
      you, that I wouldn't back the horse even for a place.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;A splendid stepper, too,&rdquo; exclaimed Walter admiringly, as the beautiful
      creature paced slowly round the straw-yard, with arching neck and
      distended nostrils, as though he were aware of the trainer's depreciating
      remarks, and could afford to despise them.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;That's true,&rdquo; rejoined Mr Chifney drily; &ldquo;but we don't want steppers, but
      goers; there's a vast of steppers in this world, both men and horses.&mdash;Now,
      in that box yonder, there is an animal who, in my opinion, could give <i>Blue
      Ruin</i> ten pounds; but you shall judge for yourself presently. <i>The
      King's</i> palace is this next one.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      And truly, scarce could horse be better housed than was his equine
      majesty. No light-house could be more exquisitely clean; no drawing-room
      in Mayfair more neat, or better suited to the requirements of its
      inhabitant, although of ornament, save the plaited straw that fringed the
      royal couch, there was nothing. A dim religious light pervaded this
      sanctuary, which was kept at a moderate temperature by artificial means,
      while an admirable ventilation prevented the slightest &ldquo;smell of the
      stable&rdquo; from being perceptible. The object of all this consideration was a
      magnificent bay horse, by rule of Liliput, very fitly named <i>The King</i>,
      since, if not a head taller than his fellows, he was fully &ldquo;a hand.&rdquo; His
      coat quite shone amid the gloom, and as the key turned in the door, he
      pricked his long fine ears, and turned his full eyes upon his two visitors
      inquiringly, with far more expression in his lean-jawed face than is
      possessed by many a human creature.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;This gives the world assurance of a horse indeed,&rdquo; muttered Walter to
      himself as he contemplated this wonder. &ldquo;Shew me his faults, Mr Chifney,
      for his excellences dazzle me.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Well, sir,&rdquo; whispered the trainer, looking up towards a square hole in
      the ceiling, &ldquo;it is not for me to depreciate 'the crack;' and there's a
      boy up yonder&mdash;for the horse is never left for a moment, night or day&mdash;who
      is getting too sharp to live, at least in my stables. But look at what he
      stands on.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Most men who ride think it a disgrace not to know all about a horse. Every
      man who keeps a pony thinks himself qualified to &ldquo;pick&rdquo; out the winner
      from any number of thoroughbreds before &ldquo;the start;&rdquo; and when the race is
      over, protests that he <i>had</i> picked him out in his own mind, only
      something (not quite satisfactorily explained) made him distrust his own
      judgment, and back a loser.
    </p>
    <p>
      It was a great temptation to Captain Walter Lisgard, of the 104th Light
      Dragoons, to shew himself horse-wise, but he put it from him manfully, or
      rather, with strength of mind far beyond that of most men of his class.
      &ldquo;The pasterns seem to be long and strong enough,&rdquo; answered he, &ldquo;and the
      feet neither too large nor too small.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Just what my lord says,&rdquo; observed the trainer in the same low tones; &ldquo;nor
      can I make him see that there is any degree of contraction. But he is not
      <i>your</i> horse, so tell me; look now&mdash;is it not so?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      It was so, or at least it seemed to be so to the captain, as the trainer
      returned the faulty member to its proprietor, with the air of a banker
      declining a forged cheque.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;It is of small consequence to me,&rdquo; said Walter; &ldquo;but I shall be sorry if
      the winner does not come out of your stable. I took a thousand to twenty
      in October, which I can now hedge to great advantage.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;If you take my advice, you will hold on,&rdquo; said Mr Chifney confidentially.
      &ldquo;Twenty pound is little to lose, and what I have shewn you by no means
      destroys his chance; moreover, <i>The King</i> will not be deposed in the
      betting. I shall be surprised if, in the paddock, they lay more than three
      to one.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You were going to tell me something, Mr Chifney, only you thought better
      of it,&rdquo; said Captain Lisgard, laying his finger upon the other's coat-cuff
      as they emerged from the royal presence. &ldquo;And yet you trusted me when I
      was but a boy at school, and I never abused your confidence.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;What a fellow you are to read a chap!&rdquo; returned the trainer admiringly.
      &ldquo;Burst my buttons, but you are a cunning one, Master Walter! It is true
      that I was thinking of letting you into a little secret&mdash;though,
      after all, it mayn't be worth much. Let us come on to the tan-gallop for
      five minutes, for nowhere else can we get out of earshot of these boys.&rdquo;
       With that, passing through a paddock, itself provided with a straw-ride,
      so that the race-horses need not set foot upon the frost-bound turf as
      they issued forth to exercise, Mr Chifney led the way to the upland, where
      a broad brown road of tan was permanently laid on the level down. Here the
      trainer paused, and speaking aloud for the first time, observed in a
      solemn tone: &ldquo;Now, look you, true as fate, I would tell no other man but
      you. What I said about <i>The King's</i> feet was on the square: but that
      ain't all. There's a horse here as nobody ever heard of, and yet who's a
      real good un. He's the one that I said could give <i>Blue Ruin</i> ten
      pounds. You may get two hundred to one against him at this blessed moment,
      and he'll be at twenty to one before April Fool Day. It's the best thing
      we've had at Mirk yet, and&mdash;&mdash; Ah, the devil! here comes the man
      I was expecting; remember, we were talking about <i>The King</i>.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Morning, Mr Chifney,&rdquo; said the new-comer, nodding familiarly to the
      trainer.&mdash;&ldquo;And morning to <i>you</i>, sir, if you ain't too proud to
      accept it.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      He was a large-built middle-aged man, with a sunburnt countenance,
      generally good-humoured enough, notwithstanding the presence of a
      truculent red beard, but upon this occasion, somewhat sullen, and even
      defiant. Walter recognised in him the stranger stopping at the <i>Lisgard
      Arms</i>, at once, and was at no loss to account for his displeasure. He
      had doubtless received some hint that his presence at the Abbey would not
      be welcome.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Good-morning, Mr Derrick,&rdquo; returned the captain cheerfully. &ldquo;There is no
      pride about me, since, unfortunately, I have nothing to be proud of; but
      if there was, why should I not return a civil reply to a civil speech?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh, because I ain't good enough to speak to,&rdquo; answered the other
      scornfully. &ldquo;Because I ain't a gentleman, forsooth, like your high and
      mighty family. But the fact is, sir, although I have got decent blood in
      my veins myself, I come from a country where we don't care <i>that</i>&rdquo;&mdash;and
      he snapped his fingers with a noise equal to the crack of a whip&mdash;&ldquo;for
      who is a man's father, unless the man himself is worth his salt.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;That, then, must have been the reason why this good-for-nothing ruffian
      left that country,&rdquo; thought the captain; but he answered with humility:
      &ldquo;Then, I fear, I should be giving up my best chance if I went there.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Well,&rdquo; answered the stranger, somewhat mollified, &ldquo;you don't speak like
      one of them beastly aristocrats&mdash;that I will say&mdash;as though it
      were too much trouble to open their darned lips.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Mr Derrick himself did not speak like an aristocrat either; his voice,
      though rich in song, had in speech a strong northern burr, which rescued
      it from any such imputations. &ldquo;Why, if a man in my country,&rdquo; continued he,
      &ldquo;should venture to warn another off his land&mdash;unless, of course, it
      was a mining claim&mdash;as Sir Richard Lisgard&rdquo;&mdash;&mdash;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Mr Derrick,&rdquo; interrupted the captain firmly, &ldquo;I am sure that it is not
      the custom in any country in the world to abuse a man's brother to his
      face. Having said that much, I will add that, if you have received any
      rudeness from any one at the Abbey, I am sincerely sorry for it. It did
      not emanate from <i>me</i>. Mr Chifney here will give me a character so
      far.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Master Walter is as civil-spoken and well-behaved a young gentleman as
      any in the county,&rdquo; exclaimed the trainer warmly; &ldquo;and I will go bail has
      never given you or any man offence. He has just stepped in, like you, to
      see 'the crack' on which he has a little money; and since I am not one of
      those who say: 'It is no use now a days to attempt to take in your
      enemies, and therefore your friends must suffer,' I have been giving him
      some advice.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;About <i>Manylaws?</i>&rdquo; inquired the stranger suspiciously, turning sharp
      round upon the captain.
    </p>
    <p>
      The look of blank astonishment upon that gallant officer's face would have
      set at rest the doubts of a Pollaky.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;It is not my habit to disclose my customer's secrets,&rdquo; observed the
      trainer tartly; &ldquo;although I may say that, with Master Walter, everything
      is as safe as wax.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Is it so?&rdquo; quoth Mr Derrick warmly; &ldquo;then let him come with us and see
      the Black.&mdash;Only mind, Mr Walter Lisgard, I will not have that
      brother of yours bettered by a fourpenny-piece by anything you may see or
      hear to-day.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;My brother never bets upon any race,&rdquo; answered the captain quietly; &ldquo;so
      that promise is easily given.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Then come along with me and Mr Chifney,&rdquo; said the stranger, holding out
      his hairy hand in token of amity. &ldquo;You've read a deal about that crack as
      I've just been looking at; but I dare say, now, you have never so much as
      heard of this same <i>Manylaws</i>.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Not unless you mean the French horse, about which there were a few lines
      in <i>Bell</i> some time ago&mdash;<i>Menelaus</i>.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Ay, that's him. But it's called Manylaws&rdquo; explained Mr Derrick; &ldquo;for you
      wouldn't think of calling the Oaks' mare <i>Antigown</i>, I suppose, <i>Antigone</i>.
      Well, the Black ain't fancied much, I reckon; but he <i>will</i> be, Mr
      Chifney, eh? He <i>will</i> be?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;It is my opinion that he will be at very short odds indeed,&rdquo; returned the
      trainer; &ldquo;and many more people will be desirous of paying him a call than
      do him that honour just at present. This is his stable. He does not look
      quite such a likely horse as <i>The King</i>, Master Walter, does he?
      There's bone for you!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;An ounce of blood is worth a pound of bone, says the proverb,&rdquo; remarked
      the captain.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;So far as that goes, although he <i>is</i> a Frenchman,&rdquo; answered the
      trainer, &ldquo;he has Godolphin's blood in his veins. But only look at his
      ragged hips!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Ragged enough, Mr Chifney. And do you mean to say that this animal will
      be a public favourite?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;We hope not,&rdquo; returned the trainer, winking facetiously at his bearded
      friend; &ldquo;but&mdash;&mdash; Shall we tell him what we do hope, Mr Derrick?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I'll tell him myself,&rdquo; quoth the other impulsively, &ldquo;for you say the
      young gentleman is safe, and I have taken a sort of unaccountable fancy to
      him. We hope, and more than that, believe, Captain Lisgard, that that same
      ragged-hipped horse will Win the Derby!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Two hundred to one against Mr Blanquette's <i>Menelaus</i>,&rdquo; murmured
      Walter pathetically, as though it were a line from some poem of the
      affections.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;That's the present quotation,&rdquo; answered Mr Derrick with a chuckle, and
      rattling a quantity of loose silver and gold in his breeches' pockets.
      &ldquo;Perhaps you would like to lay it in ponies with Mr Chifney and me.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;No, Mr Derrick; but I should like to thank you very much for letting me
      into this secret, which, I assure you, shall never pass my lips;&rdquo; and he
      held out his hand to the stranger.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Our way lies together as far as the inn,&rdquo; returned the other warmly;
      &ldquo;we'll liquor&mdash;&mdash; But there; I forgot I was no longer in
      Cariboo. I dare say a gentleman like you <i>don't</i> liquor so early in
      the day.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;At all events, I will walk with you, my good sir,&rdquo; answered the captain
      laughing; and so, forgetting to repeat his request to be permitted to pay
      his respects to the trainer's wife, he took his departure with his new
      acquaintance.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;And who <i>is</i> this Monsieur Blanquette?&rdquo; inquired Walter carelessly
      as they walked down the village street.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;He was a mate of mine at the gold-diggings in British Columbia, and the
      only Frenchman as ever I saw there. We did a pretty good stroke of work
      together; and when we came home, he invested his money in horseflesh, and
      that there <i>Manylaws</i> was one of his cheapest bargains.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I think I saw it stated somewhere that Mr Blanquette is only part-owner
      of the horse?&rdquo; observed the captain inquiringly.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;That's so,&rdquo; rejoined the other. &ldquo;It belongs to him and a company.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;And you are the company, eh, Mr Derrick?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You have hit it,&rdquo; responded the bearded man with the air of a proprietor.
      &ldquo;This here child is the <i>Co.</i> in question.&rdquo;
     </p>

      CHAPTER VII. A BROKEN FRIENDSHIP.
    </h2>
    <p class="pfirst">
      <span class="dropcap" style="font-size: 4.00em">W</span>EEKS and months
      have passed by at Mirk Abbey; the snow has thawed, and the cold winds of March have done their worst,
      and the spring is clothing nature's nakedness with garments of green. Yet
      all this time, my Lady, who is so fond of outdoor exercise, even in rough
      weather, and such a constant visitor of the poor, has never been seen
      beyond the Park gates. To be sure, she has had more to keep her within
      than usual, for the captain has got his
      leave prolonged at the beginning of the year, but came home for three
      weeks very shortly after, and is at Mirk again at the present time. Miss
      Rose Aynton, too, a very nice young lady, and most attentive to her
      hostess, seems to have become quite a resident at the Abbey, for, with the
      exception of a week's absence in London, she has remained there since
      Christmas, her departure having indeed been vaguely fixed more than once,
      but only to be as indefinitely postponed. It is now understood that she
      will certainly stay over the festivities attendant upon Sir Richard's
      coming of age in June. The baronet himself, who, his detractors say,
      always prefers the country, where he is somebody, to town, where baronets
      are plentiful, has scarcely been away at all. He writes to inquiring
      friends in London, most of whom happen to have marriageable daughters,
      that he is immersed in business connected with the estate, and cannot
      leave Mirk at present. Mr Rinkel, the agent, however, has seen no cause to
      relax his ordinary exertions, in consequence of this new-born application
      of the young gentleman to his own affairs; and Walter wickedly asserts
      that his brother is in reality occupied with no other business whatever,
      save that of keeping the man Derrick from trespassing upon the Abbey
      lands. He is very glad, he says, that Richard has at last found an object
      in life, and hopes that, like the French sportsman's woodcock, it will
      last him for a good long time.
    </p>
    <p>
      It does not help to heal the breach between the brothers that Walter and
      this same man have grown very intimate, a fact which Sir Richard (assuming
      to himself a metaphor usually applied only to Providence) stigmatises as
      &ldquo;flying in his face.&rdquo;&mdash;His mother, however, declines to take this
      view of it&mdash;declines even to express an opinion about it one way or
      another, and avoids the subject as much as she can. Even with the
      confidential maid, notwithstanding her decision about Mr Derrick's
      ineligibility as a suitor, she forbears to reason with respect to this
      matter, although it is understood that the forbidden swain is gaining
      ground in the affections of Mistress Forest. There is but one person to
      whom my Lady has opened her lips concerning the man she dimly saw by
      lantern-light on Christmas Eve, and has never seen since. Her confidant&mdash;if
      one can be called so to whom so little was confided&mdash;is Mr Arthur
      Haldane, the only son of the doctor, and one who has been a great
      favourite with Lady Lisgard from his youth up, not for his own sake
      merely, although he is honest and kind, and very winning with those who
      look beyond externals (for he is not goodlooking, or, at least, does not
      appear so by contrast with her own handsome sons), but for another reason:
      my Lady owed him a reparation of love for a wrong that she had
      inadvertently done his father.
    </p>
    <p>
      Dr Haldane and the late Sir Robert had been at school together, and their
      boy-friendship had lasted, as it seldom does, through their university
      course. Their mutual esteem had not afterwards suffered by propinquity,
      when they came to pass their days within a few hundred yards of one
      another; and when my Lady married, she found that the dearest friend her
      husband had on earth was Dr Haldane. She was not the woman to come between
      her husband's friends and himself; and the doctor (who had had his doubts
      about the matter before he came to know her) was wont to declare the Abbey
      was even more of a second home to him than it used to he, now that his old
      friend had placed so charming a mistress at the head of it. He was always
      welcome there, and being himself a widower, was glad to take advantage of
      Sir Robert's hospitality whenever he could; a knife and fork were laid for
      him at table all the year round; and when he did not appear at the
      dinner-hour, either husband or wife was sure to observe: &ldquo;I am afraid we
      shall not see the doctor with us to-day.&rdquo; It would have seemed as though
      nothing short of death could have interrupted such cordiality as this.
    </p>
    <p>
      But in those days there was such a thing as Politics. The baronet was a
      Tory, and his friend a Whig of what was afterwards called &ldquo;advanced
      opinions.&rdquo; They bickered over their wine three nights out of every seven,
      though they never failed to drink each other's healths before they sought
      the company of the hostess. These political discussions (unfortunately, as
      it turned out) were scrupulously confined to the diningroom, so that my
      Lady had no idea of the strength of the respective prejudices of the
      combatants, and of the severity of the trial to which their friendship was
      so often subjected. Brought up as she had been among persons in humble
      life, who were engaged in bread-winning (a very monopolising occupation),
      and educated in France, where the question of English reform was never
      mooted, she knew little or nothing of the matters which formed the
      subjects of dispute, although they were setting half England together by
      the ears. It seems strange to read of now, but the idol which Toryism had
      set up to worship at that epoch was a heartless and vulgar fop, whom it
      sycophantically dubbed the First Gentleman in Europe; while the Whigs
      pinned their faith upon the virtue of his wife, a woman as vulgar as
      himself, and whom her enemies endeavoured to shew was almost as vicious.
      Over this good-for-nothing pair, Lords, Commons, and People were
      quarrelling together, like a mob at a dog-fight, and the public press was
      solely occupied with hounding them on. To dip into a newspaper of that
      date is to make an excursion to Billingsgate, for both parties, equally
      unable to whitewash their candidate, confined themselves to vilifying
      their opponent.
    </p>
    <p>
      When the report upon the bill of Pains and Penalties against Queen
      Caroline was finally approved by a majority of nine only, and those nine
      representing the votes of the ministers themselves, the popular excitement
      culminated. The Whigs decreed that there should be illuminations
      throughout the kingdom, and (what seems hard) that their adversaries
      should express the same satisfaction in a similar manner. For three
      consecutive nights, the Londoners made plain the innocence of their queen,
      so far as pyrotechnics and oil-lamps could do it; and for one night, the
      country was expected to do the like. Vast mobs paraded the streets of the
      provincial towns, to see that this was done, and even made excursions to
      the country-houses of the Disaffected. Among others, Mirk Abbey was
      threatened with a visitation of this sort; and I must confess that the
      doctor rather chuckled over the notion, that the stubborn Sir Robert, who
      had called his sovereign lady so many opprobrious epithets, would have to
      dedicate his candles to her, as though she were his patron saint. The
      baronet, on his part, protested that every window in his house should be
      broken rather than exhibit so much as a farthing-dip; but he said nothing
      to his wife about the matter, lest it should make her nervous.
    </p>
    <p>
      They happened to be engaged to pass that November week at a friend's house
      in the country, and left home accordingly.
    </p>
    <p>
      The gentleman with whom they stayed himself suffered some inconvenience
      from the rioters on the night in question; and when Sir Robert came back,
      he was even less inclined to be a convert to his Whig friend's opinions
      than before.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;But you <i>did</i> illuminate,&rdquo; said the doctor with a chuckle, as they
      sat together after dinner, as usual, upon the day of his return.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I did nothing of the kind, sir,&rdquo; returned the baronet angrily.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Well, your servants did it for you, then, and I presume by your orders.
      Mr Brougham himself could not have exhibited his patriotism more
      significantly. The Abbey was a blaze of light from basement to garret.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;That is a lie!&rdquo; cried Sir Robert, making the glasses jump with the force
      with which he brought his fist down upon the table.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;A what?&rdquo; exclaimed the doctor, rising from the table livid with rage. &ldquo;Do
      you, then, call me a liar?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes,&rdquo; thundered the baronet; &ldquo;like all your radical crew.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      The two men that had so long been nearer and dearer to each other than
      brothers never again interchanged one word.
    </p>
    <p>
      Dr Haldane left the Abbey, solemnly protesting that he would never cross
      its threshold again during the lifetime of its owner; and he kept his
      determination even in the hour when his old friend lay a-dying.
    </p>
    <p>
      Now, poor Lady Lisgard was the person to blame for all this. Before Sir
      Robert and she had set out on their visit, the housekeeper had told her
      that everybody was going to illuminate their houses on the 12th, on
      account of what had happened in London with respect to Queen Caroline; and
      she was afraid that if some sign of rejoicing was not shewn at the Abbey,
      the mob would do some damage. A candle in each of the windows would save a
      hundred pounds of mischief belike. &ldquo;Well, then, put a candle,&rdquo; said my
      Lady, not dreaming that by that simple order she was wounding her husband
      in his most vital point, his pride, and making a sacrifice of principles
      that he held only second to those of the Christian Religion. She did not
      even think it necessary to tell him that she had left this command behind
      her; but when she heard him praise the determination of the friend with
      whom they stayed, not to submit to the dictation of the rabble, she had
      not the heart to tell him of the mistake she had committed, and which it
      was by that time too late to remedy. That mistake, and, still more, her
      unfortunate reticence, had caused the quarrel, destined never to be
      healed, betwixt her husband and his friend. They both forgave her, but she
      could not forgive herself. It seemed to her that she could never do enough
      to shew how sorry she was for her grievous fault. We have said how she
      made up so far as was in her power, in love and duty to Sir Robert, for
      the loss of his friend; but to that friend himself, self-exiled from her
      roof, and out of the reach, as it were, of reparation, how was she to
      atone for the wrong she had inadvertently done him? When the quarrel first
      took place, the doctor's wrath was quite unquenchable; he would listen to
      nothing except an apology&mdash;a debt which Sir Robert (although he
      certainly owed it) most resolutely refused to pay. The doctor, who had
      hitherto confined his Whiggism to after-dinner eloquence, and coarse but
      biting epigrams, which had earned him the reputation of a philosopher with
      those of his own party, thereupon became an active political partisan, and
      not only voted at election-time, but canvassed with might and main against
      the Lisgard interest; nay, he even composed, as we have ventured to hint,
      satirical ballads against the paternal rule of that respectable family.
    </p>
    <p>
      But although neither sex nor age was spared in those savage days, not one
      word did the vengeful doctor breathe about my Lady; nay, it was on record
      that when some too uncompromising apostle of Liberty had reflected upon
      her humble extraction in the presence of that friend estranged, he had
      risen to his full height of five feet eight, and levelled the slanderer to
      the earth. Perhaps my Lady did not esteem him the less upon that account;
      but certain it was that the first visit she paid after Sir Robert's death
      was to the doctor's house, taking with her, it was said, from her
      husband's dying lips, a message of affectionate reconciliation. The
      baronet had never brought himself to alter the words in his will by which
      he had appointed his tried and loving friend, Bartholomew Haldane, trustee
      for his children; and of course the doctor accepted his trust. He never
      could be induced to visit the Abbey, although his oath no longer forbade
      it; but the Lisgard children were his constant guests, and his only son,
      Arthur Haldane, was as another brother to them, and almost as another son
      to my Lady. His nature was grave and serious, like Sir Richard's, but very
      tender withal, and she felt that she could confide in him what she could
      not have confided to the rigid young baronet, although he was her own
      flesh and blood; nevertheless, or perhaps for that very reason, when she
      took Arthur's arm that April morning, upon pretence of shewing him some
      alterations that were proposed to be made at a place in the Abbey-grounds
      called the &ldquo;Watersmeet,&rdquo; she thought it necessary to preface what she was
      going to say to him with an explanation.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;My dear Arthur,&rdquo; said she, when they had got out of view of the house,
      &ldquo;you will think it cruel that I have brought you away from the society of
      that charming young lady, Miss Aynton, to chat with an old woman like me,
      who have boys of my own to take counsel with; but the fact is, I have
      inveigled you hither to get an opinion from you which I could scarcely ask
      of your learned brother.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      This was conferring a brevet rank upon Sir Richard, who had not yet been
      called to the Bar, although he was reading for it; while Arthur had been
      in practice for some years.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;My dear Lady Lisgard,&rdquo; returned the other smiling, &ldquo;I must, for my
      professional credit's sake, enter my protest against what you say about
      Miss Aynton, as irrelevant, and travelling out of the record, but besides
      that, it is a delusion which I should be sorry to see you entertain. Miss
      Aynton is nothing whatever to me; although, indeed, if she were, I would
      rather chat with you than with any young lady (save one) in Christendom.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      The young barrister's tone was so unnecessarily earnest and impressive,
      that one so acute as Lady Lisgard could scarcely have failed to see that
      he courted inquiry concerning such excess of zeal. She either saw it not,
      however, or refused to see it; and he was far too delicate by nature to
      press it upon her attention. &ldquo;And now, <i>ma mère</i>,&rdquo; continued he,
      taking her hand in his affectionately, &ldquo;in what way can I be of use to
      you?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;By your good sense, and by your good feeling, Arthur. I need the aid of
      your talents and your virtues, too, dear boy; I want your best advice, and
      then your promise that you will never disclose that I have asked it.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You shall have both those, ma mère. As the pashas say to the sultan when
      there is nothing to fear: 'I bring you my head;' as for my heart&mdash;that
      has been devoted to you these many years.&rdquo;

      CHAPTER VIII. AT THE WATERSMEET.
    </h2>
    <p class="pfirst">
      <span class="dropcap" style="font-size: 4.00em">L</span>ADY LISCARD and
      her young friend had by this time arrived at the Watersmeet, a lovely
      spot, where the river branched into two streams, the one still pursuing
      its course through the Lisgard property, and the other escaping under a
      sort of swing palisade&mdash;which prevented the passage of boats&mdash;into
      public life. The way had lain for some time along a broad beech-walk,
      paved with an exquisite checker-work of light and shade; but they now came
      upon an open spot on which a rustic bench was placed for those who would
      admire at leisure what was called the home-view. The prospect from this
      seat was remarkable, since it took in all that was best worth seeing at
      Mirk, without laying under contribution anything, with the exception of
      the church, that was not the property of the family. Two sides of the
      Abbey, an irregular but very picturesque structure, could from here be
      seen, at a distance not so great as to lose the bolder features of the
      architecture, or to mass the ivy which Time had hung about the southern
      front; the sloping lawn, with its marble fountain, and alcove of
      trellis-work, which the spring-time had but sparely clothed with leaf; the
      boat-house, with its carved and gilded roof&mdash;all these, backed by a
      living wall of stately woods, made up a charming picture. The Park lay
      across the stream, which, although both broad and deep, was only used by
      pleasure-boats; and above the one-arched bridge which linked it with the
      hither bank beyond the lawn, stood up the gray church tower. Gazing upon
      this view, not as one who had seen it a thousand times before, and might
      behold it as often again, but with eyes that had a strange yearning and
      regret in them, Lady Lisgard thus addressed her companion.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I want to speak to you about my Walter, Arthur. A mother, alas! cannot
      know her son as his friend knows him; and you, I believe, are Walter's
      truest friend&rdquo;&mdash;&mdash;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;One moment, Lady Lisgard,&rdquo; interrupted the young man gravely; &ldquo;everybody
      is Walter's friend, but some are his flatterers. I must tell you at once
      that he is displeased with me at present because I am not one of those.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes; you have warned him of some danger, and he is piqued because he
      thinks that is treating him as a child.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Since you know that, <i>ma mère</i>, you know all that is necessary to be
      said. Go on.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;What is the bond, Arthur, that links my Walter to this person Derrick? I
      pray you, do not hesitate to tell me. There is more depends upon your
      answer than you can possibly guess.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Really, Lady Lisgard,&rdquo; returned the young man hesitatingly, &ldquo;you ask a
      difficult thing, and, in truth, a delicate. There are some things, as you
      say, which a son does not tell his mother, and far less wishes to have
      told to her by another. Women and men take such different views of the
      same matter. If men are vicious&mdash;which I do not deny&mdash;in their
      love of horse-racing, for instance, women reprobate it in an exaggerated
      way.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Horse-racing!&rdquo; murmured Lady Lisgard, clasping her hands. &ldquo;Does my Walter
      bet? Is he a gambler?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I did not say that,&rdquo; answered the young man with irritation. &ldquo;If you
      insist upon making me a tale-bearer, Lady Lisgard, do not at least
      heighten the colour of my scandals.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I beg your pardon, Arthur; I was wrong. Perhaps this eagerness to suspect
      the worst is the cause of that distrust which the young entertain of the
      old. And yet <i>he</i> might have told me all, and been sure of
      forgiveness.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Doubtless, <i>ma mère</i>; but then we don't tell our mothers all. Now,
      pray, be reasonable, and assure yourself that Walter is no worse than
      other young men, because he makes up a book upon the Derby.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;<i>You</i> do not do so, Arthur. Why should Walter?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;<i>I</i> do not, <i>ma mère</i>, because my taste does not lie in that
      direction. My vices&mdash;and I have plenty&mdash;are of another sort. I
      unsettle my mind with heterodox publications. I entertain opinions which
      are subversive of the principles of good government as believed in by your
      Ladyship's family. You know in what sort of faith I have been brought up.
      Moreover, I live in town among a slow, hard-working set, who have neither
      time nor inclination for going to race-courses; and, indeed, I am now
      getting a little practice at the bar myself. If I were a handsome young
      swell in a regiment of Light Dragoons, then, instead of publishing that
      amusing work upon the <i>Law of Entail</i>, which, with a totally
      inexcusable pang, I saw lying upon your library-table to-day <i>uncut</i>,
      I should without doubt be making a betting-book. Having no call towards
      that sort of employment, however, I am very severe upon it. I term it
      waste of time, loss of money, &amp;c.; and in the case of your son, I have
      even been so foolish as to remonstrate with him on that very account&mdash;an
      interference which, I fear, has cost me his friendship.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Has he lost money through this man Derrick, think you?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Not yet, or they would not be upon such good terms. A turf friendship
      ceases at the first bad bet. The fact is, it was about his imtimacy with
      this drunken fellow that I ventured to speak; it increases the
      misunderstanding already unhappily existing between your sons; for you
      know what a dislike Sir Richard has shewn for this person, while for
      Walter himself I believe him to be a most dangerous acquaintance.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Dangerous?&rdquo; inquired my Lady hurriedly&mdash;&ldquo;how mean you dangerous?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;He is bad company for any young man, and he has acquaintances who are
      worse. Walter is 'hail-fellow-well-met' with everybody, and may find
      himself one day so deeply involved with these folks, that extrication may
      not be easy. He has plenty of wits, and well knows how to take care of
      himself in a general way; but all his great advantages are useless to him
      among this particular class. His genial wit, his graceful ways, his
      tenderness of heart&mdash;nay, even his high spirits, all go for nothing
      with such vulgar good-for-naughts, whom, in my opinion, he will be lucky
      not to find downright cheats and scoundrels.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Is this man Derrick, then,&rdquo; inquired my Lady, gazing fixedly upon the
      dark swirling stream, &ldquo;irredeemably base and vicious?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;No, not so,&rdquo; answered the young man frankly; &ldquo;he has the lees of good
      still left in him, without which, indeed, he would be less harmful. Walter
      was taken from the first with his openness and candour&mdash;which are so
      great that he seems quite lost to the sense of shame&mdash;and with his
      lavish generosity, which is probably the result of rapid fortunemaking. He
      made five thousand pounds or so, it seems, in a few weeks at gold-digging,
      and I should think he was in a fair way to spend it in almost as short a
      period.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Perhaps he may have been spoilt by that mode of life,&rdquo; observed Lady
      Lisgard pitifully.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I speak as I find, ma mère,&rdquo; said the young man, shrugging his shoulders.
      &ldquo;It is nothing to us if this man may have been a good boy at one time. You
      may charitably suppose, if you like, that he has been crossed in love, or
      unfortunately married&mdash;&mdash;&mdash; Ah! that reminds you, I see, of
      his <i>tendresse</i> for Mistress Forest. Since it moves you so deeply,
      you must look that matter in the face, Lady Lisgard, and very soon, if you
      wish to keep Mary. If something about this fellow pleases Walter, you need
      not wonder that it has fascinated your waiting-maid.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Is it this fancy of his, then, think you, which alone keeps him here at
      Mirk?&rdquo; asked my Lady, who had started for a moment as though stung, but
      was now once more looking thoughtfully at the river.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;No. Being totally without anchorage in the world, the cable-strand of a
      partnership in a race-horse at present at Chifney's stables here holds him
      to the place where he can be near his property. His pecuniary affairs are,
      as I understand, bound up in that fourfooted creature, and beyond them he
      has nothing to look to. You who have all things settled about you, Lady
      Lisgard, with home, children, and friends, and from whom so many interests
      radiate, are doubtless unable to picture to yourself such a state of
      things. But if this man should marry Mistress Forest, and still keep his
      share in <i>Menelaus</i>, I should not be surprised if he were to take up
      his residence at Mirk altogether.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;God in his mercy forbid!&rdquo; ejaculated my Lady, clasping her hands.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;My dear Lady Lisgard!&rdquo; cried the young man, in alarm at her emotion, &ldquo;I
      am afraid I must have said something very foolish, to have frightened you
      about this fellow thus. After all, there is no harm done, and I may have
      been very wrong&mdash;as my mind misgives me, I have been very officious&mdash;in
      anticipating any harm.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;No, no,&rdquo; cried my Lady, rocking herself to and fro; &ldquo;your good sense has
      only told you Truth. Do not&mdash;do not forsake me, Arthur. I look to you
      not only for warning, but for succour. Are you sure that you have told me
      all? Is there no other reason besides those you have mentioned why this
      man, having lain in wait, and entrapped my Walter, should sit down before
      this house, and, as it were, besiege it thus?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Well, Lady Lisgard,&rdquo; returned the young man gravely, &ldquo;there is, I fear,
      another reason; but it is one I am very loath to speak of&mdash;&mdash;-
      Are you cold, <i>ma mère?</i> I fear it is too early for this sitting by
      the river.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;No, Arthur, I am not cold. Why should you hesitate to tell me anything
      about this&mdash;this stranger?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Because, Lady Lisgard, I respect you as though you were indeed my mother&mdash;as
      you have shewn towards me always a mother's love; and this matter in some
      sort concerns yourself.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;<i>Myself?</i>&rdquo; whispered my Lady hoarsely. &ldquo;No, not myself, good Arthur.
      What can there be in common between this man&mdash;whom I have never seen&mdash;and
      me?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Ay, there it is,&rdquo; replied the young man quietly. &ldquo;It would have been far
      better had you not shut yourself up, as you have done these three months,
      expressly to avoid this fellow&mdash;by that means making him think
      himself of consequence.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Who says I have done that?&rdquo; asked my Lady vehemently, &ldquo;Who dares to say
      it? Why should I fear him? Why should I think about him well or ill? What
      is he to me, or I to him?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Ay, what indeed, <i>ma mère!</i> All this arises from giving ourselves
      such airs, and carrying matters with so high a hand: you have nothing but
      Sir Richard's pride to thank for it, to which I must say, in this
      instance, you have injudiciously, and, most unlike yourself, succumbed. It
      was a harsh measure, surely, to forbid this man your house, when coming,
      as you knew he would, upon a lawful errand of courtship; but to serve the
      landlord of an inn with notice of ejectment if a certain guest should not
      remove himself&mdash;which your eldest son has caused to be done with
      Steve&mdash;is a most monstrous exercise of authority. No wonder this
      Derrick was greatly irritated; any man so treated would be: but, in the
      present case, Sir Richard has made the unhappiest mistake. He is dealing
      with one who is to the full as obstinate as himself; and (what makes the
      odds overwhelmingly against him) a man entirely reckless and unprincipled.
      Your son does not understand how any one can be proud who is not a
      gentleman. Now, this fellow is possessed of a very devil of pride. He is
      come from an outlying colony, where there is conventional respect for
      nothing; and where every man does pretty much what is right in his own
      eyes. He has been lucky there; raised by a freak of fortune, and not by
      plodding industry (although he has doubtless worked hard too), to
      comparative wealth, he is by no means inclined to consider people his
      superiors. A beggar on horseback if you will, he is still <i>mounted</i>,
      and may ride in Rotten Row itself if it pleases him. He resents, of
      course, being thus meddled with; he is one of that class who would deem it
      a great liberty in the law should it punish his actual transgressions&mdash;who
      would think it hard to be smitten for his faults&mdash;but to be
      interfered with in a harmless avocation, such as lovemaking, or to be
      dictated to as to where he is to reside, stirs his bile, I can imagine,
      pretty considerably. It is my belief that he would have got tired of Mirk
      and Mary too before this, and wandered off somewhere else, scattering his
      bank-notes on the way, poor devil, like the hare in a school-boy's paper
      chase, but for this unjustifiable attempt on the part of Sir Richard to
      curtail his liberties. I am sure, also, that Walter was at first inclined
      to patronise this man, for the very reason that his brother had exhibited
      towards him such uncalled-for animosity.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;This may be all very true,&rdquo; said my Lady sighing, but at the same time
      not without a certain air of relief; &ldquo;but I cannot understand how it
      affects <i>me</i>, Arthur.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Well, you see, my dear Lady Lisgard, although Sir Richard issues these
      foolish edicts, it is you who are responsible for them; and I have no
      doubt this Derrick has been told as much. At least, I hear, that over his
      cups he has declared he will never leave Mirk till he has had a sight of
      this Queen of all the Roosias (as he terms you), who holds herself so&mdash;&mdash;
      Pardon me, <i>ma mère;</i> I was wrong to repeat this fellow's
      impertinence. Heaven help us! Why, my Lady has fainted!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Arthur Haldane spoke the truth. For the moment, Lady Lisgard's mind was
      freed from all its anxieties, of whatever nature they might be. The young
      man sprang down the bank, and dipping his handkerchief in the stream,
      applied its wet folds to her forehead. Gradual and slow the lifeblood
      flowed again, and with it thought, although confused and tangled.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Save me, save my Walter!&rdquo; murmured she. &ldquo;Tell him I will die first. He
      shall never look upon my face.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;He never shall, <i>ma mère</i> said the young man soothingly, while he
      chafed my Lady's stiffened fingers.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Keep him away!&rdquo; cried she, endeavouring to rise; &ldquo;he is tearing off my
      wedding-ring. Help! help!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;No, no, it is not he; it is I, Arthur Haldane&mdash;a well-meaning fool,
      but who has worked a deal of mischief. I have told you all I know, and I
      wish my tongue had been cut out first. It makes my heart bleed to see you
      thus distressed.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Then give me comfort, Arthur,&rdquo; groaned my Lady; &ldquo;you have warned me well,
      but what is the use of warning without advice. How shall I make him cease
      to persecute us? Gold will not buy him. I have heard of such a man, who,
      being bribed, cried but the more 'Give, give;' as the whirlpool swallows
      ship after ship, and yet gapes for more&mdash;-for navies.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Bribe him? No, Heaven forbid! That, indeed, would be the very way to keep
      him what he is&mdash;to make that chronic which is now, let us hope, but a
      passing ailment. But I would take care, if I were you, that nothing
      further he done to irritate him. He may-revenge himself&mdash;I only say
      he <i>may</i>&mdash;by doing Walter some ill turn. And, above all, you
      must persuade Mistress Forest to give him his <i>congé</i>. If once you
      get her to say 'No,' of her own freewill, he will soon tire of haunting
      the Abbey; while, if his race-horse does not do the great things expected
      of him&mdash;and what race-horse ever did?&mdash;he will soon tire of Mirk
      itself.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      My Lady shook her head.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Come, ma mère, there is no need for despondency about this fellow's going&mdash;nor,
      indeed, for much apprehension if he stays&mdash;and, moreover, I really
      think the matter lies in your own hands; at all events, you have more
      influence over your waiting-maid than any one else, and my advice is that
      you speak to her at once.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes, I will speak to her,&rdquo; said Lady Lisgard mechanically. &ldquo;Thank you,
      good Arthur, much.&rdquo; She rose from her seat, and, heaving a deep sigh as
      she turned from the fair home-scene, was about to saunter to the
      beech-walk, when the young man laid his hand upon her arm. It was the
      lightest touch, but, like that of an enchanter's wand, it seemed to remove
      all trace of selfish trouble, and in its place to evoke the tenderest
      sympathy for another.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You wish to speak to me upon your own account, dear boy; and, alas! I
      know the subject you would choose.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;<i>Alas, ma mère!</i> why <i>alas?</i> I want to talk to you about your
      Letty.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Not now, not now,&rdquo; cried Lady Lisgard. &ldquo;Spare me, dear Arthur, for this
      time; I feel so unhinged and woe-stricken, I can give you neither 'Yea nor
      'Nay.'&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I hoped that you would not have thought of 'Nay,' dear Lady Lisgard,&rdquo;
       said the young man pathetically. &ldquo;I did not look for the same cruel
      arguments of difference of station and the like from <i>you</i> as from&mdash;others.
      I shall have a home to offer your daughter such as will be wanting in no
      comfort, although it may not be one so fair as yonder Abbey. My
      professional prospects are, I am glad to say&rdquo;&mdash;&mdash;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;It is not <i>that</i>, dear boy,&rdquo; broke in Lady Lisgard hastily. &ldquo;You
      should know me better than to suppose so, Arthur; yet I cannot, nay, I
      dare not tell you what it is. It may be you will hear the truth some day,
      though never from these lips; it may be&mdash;I pray Heaven for that&mdash;that
      you will never need to hear it. But for the present, press me for no
      reply; for when you ask to be my daughter's husband, Arthur Haldane, you
      know not what you ask.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;That is what Sir Richard says,&rdquo; replied the young man bitterly. &ldquo;The
      Lisgards are such an ancient race, their blood so pure, their scutcheon&rdquo;&mdash;&mdash;&mdash;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Spare me, spare me, Arthur!&rdquo; cried my Lady earnestly. &ldquo;Give me only time,
      and I will do my best. If I have said anything to wound you, ah! forgive
      it for the sake of those old times, which you may think of some day, boy,
      not without tears, when I shall be to you but a memory. Think then&mdash;whatever's
      said&mdash;'Well, she was always kind to me; and when I wooed her daughter
      (you will own) she was kind too, although I did not think so then.'&rdquo; My
      Lady's face was hidden in her hands, but through the fair white fingers,
      as though the diamonds in her rings had started from their sockets, oozed
      the large tears.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Dear Lady Lisgard, good, kind friend, ma mère,&rdquo; exclaimed the young man,
      deeply moved, &ldquo;what sorrow is it which overwhelms you thus? I pray you,
      let me share it. I am young and strong, and I love you and yours, and
      there is help in me. Come, let me try.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;No, Arthur, no,&rdquo; answered my Lady gravely, as she once more arose, and
      re-entered the beech-walk. &ldquo;I must bear my own burden&mdash;that is only
      right and fitting. Heaven knows I am willing to suffer to the uttermost,
      if I be only permitted to suffer alone. It is when the innocent suffer for
      us that the burden galls the most. No; you can do nothing for me but keep
      silence about all that we have spoken of to-day. Not to do so, would be to
      do me a grievous hurt. You have passed your word, Arthur Haldane&mdash;remember
      that.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes, ma mère,&rdquo; replied the young man sighing. &ldquo;The Haldanes always keep
      their promises, you know.&rdquo;
     </p>

    <h2>
      CHAPTER IX. IN THE LIBRARY.
    </h2>
    <p class="pfirst">
      <span class="dropcap" style="font-size: 4.00em">O</span>F all the pleasant
      rooms&mdash;and they were many&mdash;that were to be found at Mirk Abbey,
      the Library was by far the most charming. An architect might have said
      that the rest of the house had been somewhat sacrificed to it; a bookworm
      might have wished it gloomier and more retired; but for a lover of
      literature who was also a judge of beauty, it was well-nigh perfect. It
      was upon the first floor, and occupied the space of at least three
      reception-rooms.
    </p>
    <p>
      Long as it was,
its excessive breadth might have been objected to, but that the effect of this was
      diminished to exactly the right proportions by huge double bookcases,
      which jutted out at right angles from the walls; thus the place was broken
      up, as it were, into a number of little studies, closed in upon three
      sides, but open, of course, towards what in a church would be called the
      aisle. This aisle, still a broad space, was set alternately with
      flower-vases and statues of white marble, though none of these were so
      tall as to hide from one standing at the door the view of the huge painted
      window at the southern end. In summer-time, this window was swung back,
      and all the garden scents and drowsy sounds&mdash;the level sweep of the
      scythe upon the lawn, and the murmur of the bees in the limes&mdash;were
      suffered to enter in. In winter, being closed, what light there was came
      glowing through the pictured panes, or through small windows far above the
      level of the eye, so that, in that well-warmed room, you could not tell
      that it <i>was</i> winter.
    </p>
    <p>
      And yet this stately apartment was seldom used in either season. Letty
      would sometimes take a Godly book from that part of the place marked in
      dull gold <i>Devotional</i>, but always carried it away to read in her own
      chamber; and Sir Richard now and then would refresh himself in the
      topographical department by taking down the <i>History of Wheatshire</i>,
      where all the Family Seats were duly pictured, and the linked sweetness
      of' the genealogy of the owners long drawn out; but the Lisgards were not
      a reading race. Moreover, when they did read, it was chiefly out of modern
      books temporarily supplied by Mr Mudie, or works most glorious to behold
      as to their bindings, and without which no lady's drawing-room can be said
      to be complete, but which happily are rarely seen in libraries. My Lady
      herself had a goodly store of books in her own boudoir, including most of
      the French and English classics, all presented to her at divers times by
      her late husband, and all read, if not for her own pleasure, then for his;
      she therefore visited the Library more rarely than any one except Walter,
      who would as soon have thought of visiting the laundry. The last time she
      had gone thither was just after Miss Aynton's first arrival, when she had
      taken that young lady to see some curious missals there deposited,
      containing certain initial letters which Rose was desirous of copying.
    </p>
    <p>
      She enters it now alone upon her return from that interview with Arthur
      Haldane at the Watersmeet&mdash;on a very different errand. She is no
      longer the kind of somewhat stately hostess, doing her young guest a
      pleasure, and at the same time perhaps taking a pardonable pride in
      shewing her the gem of the Abbey&mdash;its Library&mdash;for the first
      time. All pride, all stateliness, seem to have departed from that anxious
      face; her figure, however, is erect as of old, and her step as firm, as
      she closes the door of the vast room behind her, and walks towards its
      southern end. She looks neither to left nor right, for she is in search of
      none of those volumes which line the Library on either side. The place for
      which she is bound is in a far corner next the window, but very indirectly
      lighted by it; a small &ldquo;study,&rdquo; where, if such a thing as dust were
      permitted to accumulate at the Abbey at all, it would certainly lie; and
      where it did lie; a spot unvisited for years, ever since it had been
      determined that Sir Richard's profession should be the Law, when certain
      books were taken from it, and carried up to town to stock his chambers;
      for over this little literary den was written Legal. Truly, as the phrase
      goes, &ldquo;it was not a place for a lady,&rdquo; that dusky little chamber, lined
      with its bulky, calf-bound volumes, mostly in series, and often as not
      connected with one another by that emblem of their contents, a spider's
      web. What could my Lady have come hither to cull from such unpromising
      books? Is it possible that, unmindful of the proverb, that he who is his
      own lawyer has got a fool for his client, she can be in search of legal
      advice gratis? It is plain that she is in doubt, alas, even where to find
      the information of which she is in search. Her soft white hand wanders
      from tome to tome, and drags down one after another from its dusty shelf,
      until she has peopled the sunbeams anew with motes; but her large gray
      eyes find nothing to arrest them as they wander over the arid pages,
      although they grow weary with their task.
    </p>
    <p>
      At last, however, they seem to have been more fortunate. For the first
      time, my Lady takes her seat beside the slanting desk, and with her head
      supported by her hands, like one who is in need of all her wits, she reads
      on patiently enough. She cons the matter over twice or thrice, then sighs,
      and putting a thin slip of paper in the book to mark the place, returns it
      to its shelf, and pursues her search as before. Out of several score of
      volumes, four only seem to have served her purpose, and even from them it
      is evident that she has gleaned no comfort, but rather confirmation of
      some fear. Her face is more hopeless than it was a while ago; her sigh&mdash;and
      she sighs deep and often&mdash;has despair in it, as well as sorrow. From
      her wearied eyes, as she gazes upon the opened casement&mdash;through
      which comes a dreamy music in the flutter of the young leaves on a
      neighbouring elm, and the silver leap of the fountain on the lawn&mdash;tear
      follows tear, although she knows it not, and glides down the new-made
      furrows in her cheeks.
    </p>
    <p>
      The luncheon gong was beaten an hour ago, and then was taken out into the
      garden for her especial behoof, and beaten again; but my Lady heard it
      not. She has neither eyes nor ears for the present at all. She is thinking
      of some Future more dark and terrible than death itself, a day of
      dishonour and disgrace, that is creeping slowly but surely upon her and
      hers. The young leaves babble of it already, and the fountain with its
      talking water, and every whispering breath of April wind; and now she
      listens to them; and now she tries in vain to think and think; and now she
      listens to them perforce again. They are comforters these mysterious
      voices, and do but pretend to prattle of her woes, in order that they may
      woo her to oblivion; for presently the tired arms can no more bear the
      burden of that piteous face, but sink down on the desk, and on those soft
      and rounded cushions droops the careworn head; and the eyelids that have
      scarce shut throughout the livelong night, nor through many a night
      before, are closed in slumber. The bee-music, the falling water, and the
      lullaby of the April leaves, through Nature's kindly hands, have given my
      Lady a nepenthe draught; and, thanks to it, she has forgotten her woes;
      nay, more, it has substituted for them joys borrowed from the unreturning
      Past, which, while we tarry in Dreamland, are as real as any.
    </p>
    <p>
      My Lady is once more a fisherman's daughter, upon the banks of Blea. The
      river that flows beside her father's door is almost as salt as the sea
      itself, and twice a day the sea itself comes up and fills the creeks, and
      sets afloat the boats and colliers that lie sideways on the oozy beach.
      When it retires, she longs to be taken with it, for ere that tide can
      reach the open sea, it must needs pass by the port of Bleamouth, where her
      lover Ralph dwells. Young as she is, she has been wooed by others, and
      they better matches than this roving sailor, who, although he has saved a
      little money, does not know, says her father, how to keep it; and when
      that is gone, how will he keep himself save by going to sea again; much
      more, then, how will he keep wife Lucy and a household? But these wise
      sayings are naught in Lucy's ears, in which love whispers always its
      smooth prophecies, and Ralph's rich laugh dispels the old man's
      forebodings, or plays upon them as though they were the very strings of
      mirth.
    </p>
    <p>
      As handsome and stout-hearted a lad he is as ever was fitted to make his
      own way through the world; able enough to thrust to left and right all
      jostling compeers, and by no means one to lack or to let those dear to him
      lack, while bread is to be got by sweat of brow. A smile comes o'er my
      Lady's face, and makes it young again, the while she dreams; for now she
      sees his signals in the coming boat, and now himself, and now he leaps
      ashore, and clasps her with his stalwart arm, and now her fingers play
      with the dark locks that curl above his tanned and manly brow. 'Tis more
      than half a lifetime back&mdash;but she knows not that&mdash;and the
      colour comes again to the wan cheek as though it were a maiden's, and once
      more love awakens in her widowed heart. He speaks; but ere his tongue can
      shape the words, a sense of doubt begins to perplex and pain her. She is a
      girl, and yet a woman in the vale of years; a fisher's daughter though a
      lady bred, with all the circumstances of rank and wealth about her; the
      voice is her lover's voice, and yet sounds strangely like another's; she
      is on the borderland 'twixt waking and sleeping, where, as in a dissolving
      view, the coming and the passing pictures interlace and exchange features,
      and the Dream and the Reality struggle together for life. Some one is
      speaking, however, that is certain, and the voice, as no woman can doubt,
      is tremulous and love-laden.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;And yet, Rose&mdash;for I may call you Rose, may I not?&mdash;beautiful
      as these pictures are, I do not think they are more exquisite than those
      which you have painted yourself.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You flatter me, Sir Richard,&rdquo; returned a second voice, with which my Lady
      was no better acquainted than with the first; for although she could not
      but be aware of who the speakers were, since they addressed one another by
      their names, she did not recognise her own son's speech, so changed it was
      from its ordinary polite but icy tones; while Rose Aynton's, upon the
      other hand, generally so quiet and submissive, were tinged with a mocking
      bitterness. If Sir Richard Lisgard was really about to lay his fortune at
      the feet of this penniless girl, it seemed strange indeed that she should
      reply to him in so unnatural a key. That the delirious joy that might well
      be at her heart should not be altogether repressible, was to be expected,
      and that her tongue should falter in endeavouring to conceal her triumph;
      but there was that in the young girl's accents different from anything
      that could be thus explained. Instead of trembling and hesitation in her
      speech, there was sheer scorn. Perhaps my Lady should have come forth at
      once from where she sat an involuntary eavesdropper; but it must be
      allowed that the temptation to remain was very great. Moreover, there were
      reasons why she could not explain her own presence in that particular
      portion of the Library; and again, should she disclose herself, the young
      people would feel no less uncomfortable than though they should even
      discover at last that their interview had not been so solitary as they
      imagined, for how did she know what had occurred while she was sleeping,
      and how should she persuade Miss Rose, even if her word was sufficient for
      Richard, that she <i>had</i> been sleeping during that critical period?
      True, if it was certain that the offer about to be made would be accepted,
      as indeed there was every likelihood that it would be, it was highly
      expedient&mdash;for various reasons known to my Lady&mdash;that she should
      step forward, and prevent matters from going further; but so strange did
      the girl's voice strike upon her experienced ear, that Lady Lisgard waited
      in hopes of she scarce knew what&mdash;some almost miracle that might make
      her personal interposition unnecessary. At the same time her curiosity
      became so excessive during the protracted pause that followed Rose's &ldquo;You
      flatter me,&rdquo; that she ventured to peer round the corner of the recess
      wherein she sat, which was now far more in shade than when she had entered
      it at noon.
    </p>
    <p>
      They were standing not very far from her&mdash;those two unconscious young
      people&mdash;in front of a huge portfolio, which leant against a statue of
      Cupid and Psyche. The old, old tale of love which the sculpture typified
      was evidently being anew repeated by one at least of the living pair. Sir
      Richard, who had been turning over the pictures, kept his hand
      mechanically on one of them, but his eyes were fixed with a winning
      softness; which even his mother had never seen in them before, upon his
      fair companion. Through one of the small western windows, the last gleam
      of the dying sun had found its way, and rested upon his crisp brown curls;
      his manly face glowed in a golden haze, while in his eyes there beamed a
      light that no sun can give, and mellower than the rays of moon or star.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I do not flatter you, sweet Rose,&rdquo; he said; &ldquo;I love you.&rdquo; She too had one
      hand upon the picture, and but for it, it seemed for a moment as though
      she would have fallen, so deadly pale she grew the while he spoke. Her
      eyelids quivered, and then slowly sank like two white rose-leaves on her
      cheek; while her unoccupied hand fell from her pale lips, and hung down by
      her side quite motionless.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;She cannot give him nay,&rdquo; thought Lady Lisgard; &ldquo;the girl is overcome
      with her great joy.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Why do you not speak, dear Rose?&rdquo; continued Sir Richard; &ldquo;or may I take
      your silence for consent, and thus set loving seal&rdquo;&mdash;&mdash;-
    </p>
    <p>
      He moved towards her, and round her dainty waist had placed his arm, when
      she sprang from him like a frightened fawn, who, although so seeming tame
      that it will hover nigh, and even follow one, darts off in terror when we
      strive to caress it.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;No, Sir Richard, no,&rdquo; cried she; &ldquo;I cannot marry you&mdash;I dare not;
      and I will not. You are much too proud and arrogant for me.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;But not <i>to</i> you, Rose,&rdquo; pleaded the young man earnestly. &ldquo;You shall
      be my mistress, I your servant always. If I have ever been proud to you, I
      pray you to forgive it. I do beseech your pardon. It seemed at first that
      I was right to be so. You do not understand how one like me&mdash;&mdash;&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;So well born and so rich,&rdquo; interrupted the young girl quietly, looking up
      into his face with steady gaze. &ldquo;Yes, I understand that well, Sir Richard;
      and I, on the other hand, a dependent girl, so inferior to the sort of
      bride that you had a right to look for; it was well to keep me at a
      respectful distance.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;No, not so, Rose,&rdquo; cried the other hastily; &ldquo;I swear that you are
      inferior to no woman whom I have ever seen. But I did not wish&mdash;&mdash;-I
      thought, at first, that it would not be for your happiness&rdquo;&mdash;&mdash;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;And your first thought was right, Sir Richard,&rdquo; broke in the other
      bitterly. &ldquo;When you said to yourself, I will not encourage this young girl
      to think it possible that she should ever be the mistress of Mirk Abbey,
      you were wise. You did right to hold yourself aloof, to behave with
      studied stiffness and formality, to let me know though I might worship
      your exalted station, and admire your handsome face&rdquo;&mdash;&mdash;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Rose! Rose!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Ay, it is Rose now, but it was Miss Aynton then,&rdquo; continued she, beating
      her foot upon the floor. &ldquo;You determined, I say, within yourself that I
      should never so forget our relative positions as to misconstrue any
      attentions you might please to pay me; you held yourself so high, and
      stooped so condescendingly when you did stoop, that, upon my part at
      least, you resolved to nip the young beginnings of love, if such there
      should be, in their very bud. And, Sir Richard Lisgard, you succeeded.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      She rose to her full height, and pointed at him with her white hand
      contemptuously; her swan-like bosom moved, with rapid ebb and flow, in
      angry scorn; her curling lips gave wormwood to her words. And yet,
      although he felt her biting speech, the young man thought he had never
      seen her half so beautiful, half so worthy to be his wife.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;It is you who are proud now, Rose,&rdquo; returned he, speaking with effort. &ldquo;I
      did not think that I could ever have heard such words from a woman's lips,
      and yet have sought to woo her. It is your turn to play the tyrant; but
      though, by Heaven, you look every inch a queen&rdquo;&mdash;&mdash;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I thank you, sir,&rdquo; interrupted the girl coldly; &ldquo;but you need say no
      more. There is no necessity to offer me that one more chance which your
      generosity suggests to you. However incomprehensible and audacious, coming
      from these humble lips, may such an answer sound, Sir Richard Lisgard is
      refused.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Rose, dear Rose,&rdquo; cried the young man passionately; &ldquo;if this be
      punishment, do not push it, I pray you, further than I can bear. There is
      something in your face in such ill accordance with your speech, that I
      cannot yet despair. Is it not possible, sweet girl, that at some future
      time&mdash;not now, but when you have seen how humble and devoted I can
      be, that you may teach your heart to love me?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;No.&rdquo; A full and rounded word, without a flaw of doubt to mar its
      clearness; a sentence irreversible; a judgment against which he felt there
      could be no appeal.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;But look you, Rose,&rdquo; continued the baronet huskily; &ldquo;it is said that the
      true love grows after marriage. Suppose I am content to wed you on that
      chance, as in very truth I am. Look you, the scene is fair you behold
      through yonder window, and all that you see is mine. The Abbey, too, is
      mine, or will be so at my mother's death.&rdquo; [A shadow of pain flits across
      my Lady's face, to hear her son speak thus so lightly of that loss, to
      please a girl whom he has not known six months, and who does not even love
      him.] &ldquo;I have broad acres, girl, fields, farms&mdash;a goodly rent-roll.
      My wife&mdash;the Lady Lisgard&mdash;will have more than enough of wealth
      to maintain her high position. Rose! have you no ambition?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Miss Aynton here again grew strangely agitated; once more her cheeks grew
      pale, and her limbs trembled beneath her.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Wretched girl! can she indeed be going to sell herself?&rdquo; thought my Lady.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;There is nothing,&rdquo; pursued the wooer, perceiving his advantage, &ldquo;which
      will be out of your reach. You will mix with those same persons to whose
      society you have been already accustomed, but in a very different relation
      towards them; you will be their equal in station, and they will be
      compelled to acknowledge that superiority in all other respects which they
      have refused to see in you while a mere dependent on your aunt's caprice.
      You will be enabled, I do not say to repay scorn for scorn&mdash;for your
      sweet nature is incapable of such revenge&mdash;but to extend to those who
      have wounded you forgiveness; to return each kindness fiftyfold.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Sir Richard Lisgard,&rdquo; replied the young girl, speaking slowly, but with
      great distinctness, &ldquo;my answer has been given you already. It is true that
      your last arguments moved me, but not for the reason you imagine. I can
      marry you neither for love nor for money. You pique yourself, I think, on
      being a gentleman; being so, you will cease to press me further. I am
      conscious of the honour you have done me in this matter, and I thank you;
      but I decline your offer.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      The young man bowed, but without speaking. His features, which had
      softened to an extraordinary degree throughout their interview, began to
      assume a look even haughtier than before; his pride was all the greater
      since he had forced himself to stoop in vain.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I have only one thing, then, to request, Miss Aynton,&rdquo; said he after a
      long silence. &ldquo;I trust that you will not permit what has just occurred to
      curtail your stay at Mirk. It is understood that you are to remain here
      until after the celebration of&mdash;of my majority.&rdquo; He could scarcely
      get the word out, poor fellow: he had looked forward so to her loving
      sympathy upon that proud occasion, which now seemed emptied of all its
      happy auguries.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Do not fear, Sir Richard,&rdquo; returned the girl with pity; &ldquo;no one shall
      know that the heir of Mirk has met with this disappointment. I will remain
      here, since you wish it. Your behaviour towards me needs no alteration to
      conceal the fact that you have ever been my lover.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      He had once more so reinstated himself in his proof-armour of pride, that
      the young baronet was not even aware that this last shaft had any barb.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I thank you, Miss Aynton,&rdquo; said he frigidly; &ldquo;if at any time it should be
      within my power to do you or yours a service, please to command me to the
      uttermost.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      He bowed, and strode away; she heard him close the door, neither softly
      nor in anger, and then his measured step upon the carpetless oaken stair
      without.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I have not broken his heart, that's certain,&rdquo; muttered Rose Aynton, with
      a crooked smile; &ldquo;the lover was lost in the patron soon indeed.&rdquo;
     </p>

      CHAPTER X. MISS ROSE AYNTON &ldquo;COPIES OUT.&rdquo;
     </h2>
    <p class="pfirst">
      <span class="dropcap" style="font-size: 4.00em">F</span>OR some minutes
      there was a total silence in the vast apartment, very oppressive to at
      least one of the two persons present, &ldquo;How long did this proud girl intend
      to remain and keep her a prisoner?&rdquo; thought my Lady. She was rejoiced that
      Miss Aynton had refused her son, but at the same time angry with her for
      having done so. Rose must surely have had some motive for it far deeper
      than the mere revenging herself upon him for fancied slights. And yet
      Letty, who was in the girl's confidence, seemed certain that she had no
      accepted lover&mdash;no previous engagement, such as alone seemed a
      sufficient reason for rejecting so advantageous a proposal. Perhaps she
      was even now repenting with tears the determination which had earned for
      her so dearly-bought a triumph. My Lady ventured to look forth once more.
      Yes, the poor girl was doubtless crying bitterly. Her face was hidden in
      her hands, but there was a convulsive movement of the round white
      shoulders that told its tale of inward grief. &ldquo;Poor thing, poor thing!&rdquo; My
      Lady's kind heart yearned towards her now that she was sorry for her
      treatment of her son. Perhaps&mdash;not knowing Sir Richard as his mother
      knew him&mdash;she might even now make some hopeless endeavour to win him
      back to her. If she succeeded, that would be the worst thing that could
      possibly happen; and if she failed&mdash;as was almost certain&mdash;then
      she would have to suffer all this pain over again. Was it not my Lady's
      duty, then, to do her best to spare this unhappy motherless girl such
      bitter disappointment and humiliation, and to comfort her all she could
      under her present trouble? At all events, after some such manner Lady
      Lisgard reasoned. She did not stop to think of herself at all&mdash;of the
      imputation of eaves-dropping to which she must necessarily expose herself&mdash;but
      stepped forth at once from the recess, and walked quietly to where Rose
      was standing. Her footsteps made no noise upon the thick matting that was
      laid down the centre of the polished floor. As she approached the
      unconscious girl, she was compelled to acknowledge to herself, for the
      first time, how strikingly attractive a young woman Miss Aynton was. She
      had certainly not the beauty of my Lady's own daughter Letty, nor was she
      so tall, or perhaps so graceful; but her figure, although it was one
      likely to get coarse in time, was really perfect; her head, exquisitely
      set on well-shaped shoulders, was small, but bore such a profusion of
      black-brown hair as would have furnished half-a-dozen ordinary young
      ladies with <i>chignons</i>; her hands and arms were plump and white. Her
      eyes&mdash;Lady Lisgard thought that she had never seen such wondrous eyes
      as those which flashed upon her now in sudden recognition, then terror,
      then rage&mdash;not a trace of tears in them, and all the white face cold
      and still, not puckered up with woe, as she had expected to see it.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;So you have been a spectator, Lady Lisgard, of the late love-scene, have
      you?&rdquo; said Rose Aynton in a low and suppressed tone. &ldquo;That was very
      generous and like a gentlewoman&mdash;in one's hostess, too.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Hush, Rose; do not say things that you may afterwards be sorry for. I
      will tell you how it happened.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Nay, do not trouble yourself, my Lady; I can guess. You knew Sir Richard
      had made an appointment with me here, and you wished to hear with what
      rapturous gratitude the penniless girl would consent to be his bride. I
      hope you <i>did</i> hear, madam, since you took such trouble.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes, Rose; I did hear. Your cruel words shall not rob you of my sympathy.
      I am sorry for my son, of course; but I am sorry for you also. I had been
      worried, vexed by many things of which it is not necessary to tell you; I
      came hither for solitude, and wearied out by many a sleepless night&mdash;nights
      of care, girl, such as I trust you may never know&mdash;I fell asleep in
      yonder recess. I never heard you enter the room at all. I woke up while
      you were speaking, but scarcely knew whether I ought to reveal myself or
      not. I heard you reject poor Richard; then, when he had gone, I thought
      that you repented having done so. I was moved at seeing you look so white
      and still. I felt for you, Rose, with all my heart, and came out, when I
      might as easily have remained concealed, to try to comfort you. My poor
      dear girl!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;That was very kind,&rdquo; returned Rose quietly. &ldquo;But if I had behaved
      otherwise, would you then have welcomed me as your daughter-in-law? Please
      to tell me that.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;If I should say 'Yes,' you would not believe me, Rose. So why ask me such
      a question. Moreover, the matter is settled now for ever. He would be a
      doting lover, indeed, who would forgive such a repulse; and Richard is the
      last man in all the world to do so.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Do you think so?&rdquo; answered the young girl with an incredulous smile. &ldquo;You
      have forgotten surely your own youth, Lady Lisgard.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;What know you of my youth, girl?&rdquo; asked my Lady hastily, her pale face
      flushing with emotion.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Nay, do not be angry,&rdquo; returned the other coldly. &ldquo;I meant nothing,
      except, that when a woman is young she is very powerful. You say that I
      have lost Sir Richard, and therefore you pity me. Now, I will wager by
      this time to-morrow that I could win him back again.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Was this the humble and submissive girl who came to Mirk four months ago,
      almost from school, and whom she had treated as a mother treats her child?
      The conscious belle of a London season could not have spoken with a
      greater confidence; the most practised husband-hunter with a cooler
      calculation. &ldquo;Come,&rdquo; continued Rose, &ldquo;if you really are so sorry for me,
      Lady Lisgard, and so distressed upon your son's account, have I your
      permission to do my best to repair this common misfortune?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      My Lady could scarce conceal a shudder at the thought how nearly had this
      coldblooded scheming girl become her daughter-in-law. Whatever objections
      she might have had to such a match before&mdash;and they were in
      themselves insuperable&mdash;seemed to have grown to twice their former
      proportions.
    </p>
    <p>
      The girl's determination and self-confidence alarmed her, too, for that
      result about which she had before felt so certain. At all hazards, she was
      resolved to prevent an attempt at reconciliation being made.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;No, Rose; I do not wish you to try to recover the affections of Sir
      Richard.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;So, so; then we have the truth at last, Lady Lisgard. You are not willing
      that I should be daughter-in-law of yours. You grudge me such great
      good-fortune as to be allied with the race of Lisgards: and yet it fell to
      your own lot&mdash;as I have heard&mdash;even in a more unexpected
      manner.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Miss Aynton, what I was is no affair of yours,&rdquo; replied my Lady with
      quivering lips. &ldquo;You have only to remember what I <i>am</i>.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I do so, madam, very well. I see you held in honour by all people, and
      without doubt, justly. Your position is indeed to me an object of
      admiration, perhaps, I may add, even of envy. Is it not natural that it
      should be so? And when your son offers to lift me from my present low
      estate to place me as high, why should I hesitate to take advantage of
      such a proposal? I have refused him, it is true; but now, being, as you
      say, repentant, why should I not strive to recover what I have let slip&mdash;wealth,
      honours, title&rdquo;&mdash;&mdash;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Rose Aynton,&rdquo; returned my Lady, clasping the girl's white wrist, and
      speaking in very earnest but broken tones, &ldquo;I warn you, do not do it. Even
      if you succeed, you may not win all you dream of. Strive not, I charge
      you, for your own sake, to undo what has been done. I have reasons for
      what I say beyond any that you can guess. If you would be happy, do not
      endeavour to ally yourself with this family.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Lady Lisgard, what <i>can</i> you mean?&rdquo; ejaculated the girl, her white
      face flushed at last, her wide flashing eyes no longer hard and cynical,
      and her every feature impatient for reply.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I mean simply what I say. Seek not to be Richard's wife. If you want
      money&mdash;and I know from your own lips it is not love which prompts you&mdash;you
      shall have such wealth as is mine to give. I had meant it for a different
      purpose; but that is no matter. Only do not seek to win back my son; and
      when you leave us, I will bless you for your forbearance&mdash;and for
      your silence, Rose.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes, Lady Lisgard, I will say nothing of all this,&rdquo; returned the girl
      thoughtfully after a short pause. &ldquo;I promise you, too, that I will never
      speak of love to Sir Richard further; and as for your offer of a bribe,
      though I do not know that I have ever shewn myself so greedy as to deserve
      it&mdash;I will forgive you even that.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Thank you, thank you, Rose,&rdquo; answered my Lady eagerly. &ldquo;I dare say, in my
      haste and trouble, I may have said things to offend you, and if so, I am
      very sorry. You have doubtless your troubles too.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes, I have,&rdquo; answered the girl gravely; &ldquo;and I should like to be alone
      with them for a little, Lady Lisgard, unless you have anything else to ask
      of me.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Nothing, Rose&mdash;nothing; you have granted all I wished. You will be
      as undisturbed here as in your own apartment; nay, even more so; for Letty
      will not think of coming here to seek you out. Nobody ever comes into the
      Library.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      My Lady leaned forward as she spoke, and kissed the girl's smooth brow,
      cold as a tablet of alabaster, then softly left the room.
    </p>
    <p>
      Rose Aynton stood for a full minute, listening, eager and motionless as
      Echo herself, before she stepped to the door, and turned the key.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;No more spying, my Lady!&rdquo; ejaculated she; &ldquo;my hostess has her secrets, it
      seems, as well as I. It would be well if I could discover hers before she
      found out mine. What could she mean by cautioning me, for my own sake, not
      to ally myself with the Lisgards? She is not a fool to think to frighten
      me with a mere gipsy's warning&mdash;threatening much, but meaning
      nothing.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      What reasons can those be against my becoming her daughter-in-law, which
      are 'beyond any that I can guess?' If I could only get this proud dame
      beneath my thumb, then, indeed, I might recompense myself somewhat for
      having missed Sir Richard. To think that I should have lost a prize like
      that through mere humility of mind! 'Yet even if you succeed,' said she,
      'you may not win all you dream of.' Those were her very words. 'Haste and
      trouble' alone could never have suggested them to her, although they may
      have made her indiscreet enough to utter them. What has put my Lady in
      such low spirits of late, and kept her so moped up within the Abbey walls?
      How came she alone here in this place, whither, as she says, 'No one ever
      comes?' She must have been hidden in yonder recess in the far corner, or
      we must needs have seen her, when my love-sick swain and I were walking up
      and down.
    </p>
    <p>
      Swift and noiseless, like some beautiful wild beast upon the trail, Rose
      Aynton crossed the room, and scanned, with a cruel look in her dark eyes,
      the little study over which was printed <i>Legal</i>.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I never heard that my Lady was given to law,&rdquo; muttered she derisively.
      &ldquo;True, she said that she had been sent to sleep, a thing which any one of
      these folios one might think would compass. But why did she come hither to
      read at all? There must have been something of interest to attract her.
      The books on this side do not seem to have been touched for ages; but here&mdash;yes,
      some one has been to these quite lately, for the dust has been disturbed,
      and here, if I mistake not, is the dainty print of my Lady's fingers. We
      are getting warm, as the children say at Hide-and-Seek. What have we here?
      A slip of paper for a marker, torn cross-wise from an envelope with <i>Lad</i>
      upon it. It was surely imprudent of my Lady to use her own address for
      such a purpose. <i>Wills!</i> Ah, she has been studying the art of making
      wills, I dare say. Considering Sir Richard is already so well off&mdash;and
      since I am not to be his wife&mdash;it is to be hoped she will leave her
      money to son Walter; and some, too, to poor dear Letty, for she is one who
      will never learn to help herself in this world. It is well for her that
      she has not to live by her wits. If she had been in my position, she would
      have been a governess. Yes, it's all about Wills this book. And why should
      not my Lady make a will, being of ripe age, and yet not old enough to
      sniff that smell of the charnel-house, which renders the operation so
      unpleasant a duty to the aged? I am afraid&mdash;unless, indeed, I could
      find the will itself&mdash;that I have but discovered a mare's nest after
      all. However, here are more book-markers; come, let us combine our
      information. <i>Succession!</i> That's only the same story. <i>Illegitimacy!</i>
      Great Heaven, but this is more than I had bargained for!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      The girl stepped swiftly to the open window, and pushed the heavy folds of
      hair behind her ears. &ldquo;I feel my blood all rushing to my brain, and
      roaring 'Ruin!'&rdquo; murmured she. &ldquo;If this sudden fear has any real
      foundation, then indeed am I hoist with my own petard. No wonder she
      warned me against alliance with her race, if what I here suspect is true.
      They will need wellborn suitors themselves, she meant, to make up for what
      is lacking in their blood, and mayhap money too. The will of old Sir
      Robert may be disputed. The Succession&mdash;but no, I had forgotten&mdash;there
      is no one to succeed save her two sons, for they have not a relative
      beyond themselves in the world, these Lisgards; but the title&mdash;that
      would be lost, of course. That's what she hinted when she said I might not
      gain the thing I counted on, even though I won Sir Richard. He cannot know
      of it; he could not be so proud if he had the least suspicion of any blot
      in his own scutcheon. How he would wither if one said to him: 'Thou
      Bastard!' And yet I gravely doubt whether this discreet madam, his mother,
      has not one day tripped. 'What know you of my youth, girl?' cried she a
      while ago, white, as I thought, with anger; but it was fear, it seems. She
      comes here alone to find out for herself by study what secret course to
      follow, or what hidden dangers to avoid, having no counsellor in whom she
      can confide. That seems so far certain, or she would surely ask her son
      himself, being a lawyer, or that wise Mr Arthur Haldane, whom I so
      honestly dislike, for their advice. It may be all this bodes as ill for
      Walter as for his brother; it may be that it bodes the younger the best of
      fortune, and the elder the worst. That would be a brave day, indeed, for
      some one, on which the proud young baronet should sink to plain Mr
      Richard, and the poor captain rise to be Sir Walter Lisgard! And, again,
      there may be nothing in all this, after all. Time will doubtless shew, and
      it shall be my task to hurry Time's footsteps towards the discovery.&rdquo;

    <h2>
      CHAPTER XI. UP EARLY.
    </h2>
    <p class="pfirst">
      <span class="dropcap" style="font-size: 4.00em">I</span>T has been justly
      observed that one half of the world does not know how the other half
      lives. The statement is a very safe one, and might have been made a great
      deal more comprehensive by the philosopher who uttered it without risking
      his reputation for sagacity. We do not know how our next-door neighbour
      lives, except in the sense of what he has for dinner, which may indeed be
      discovered by the curious; nay, we often know not how our own household
      lives, how our very sons conduct themselves when not at meal-times and
      under our very eyes, what pursuits they really follow, what hopes, what
      fears, what ambitions they in secret entertain. It is well, indeed, and
      should be a matter of congratulation, if we are quite cognizant of the
      &ldquo;goings on&rdquo; of our wives and daughters. It is strange to think what a
      world in little lies under the roof of any great mansion, such as Mirk
      Abbey. How interesting would the genuine individual biographies&mdash;if
      one could only get at them&mdash;of such a household be, from that of the
      mistress of the establishment (whose troubles we are endeavouring to
      portray) down to that of the under kitchen-maid, concerning whom we have
      &ldquo;no information,&rdquo; but who has doubtless her own temptations, wrongs, and
      troubles also, which concern her with equal nearness, although they may
      not be so genteel! It is probable that the true history of the second
      gravedigger in <i>Hamlet</i> would be to the full as interesting as what
      we know of that philosophic Prince himself, though <i>his</i> father had
      not been murdered by his uncle, albeit even that may have been the case,
      for aught we know. But, alas! the novelist has not the power which the <i>Devil
      on Two Sticks</i> possessed of lifting the tiles off the attics; but has
      generally to content himself with such glimpses as he can obtain through
      the keyholes of the first and second floors.
    </p>
    <p>
      Taking advantage of even this moderate privilege, we are sometimes
      rewarded with phenomena. Thus, it is little less than a portent to see
      Captain Walter Lisgard, who is not generally addicted to early rising, up
      and dressed upon a certain May morning before the clock on the great
      stairs has sounded three. True, he has been out of bed once or twice at
      such an hour on other occasions, but then it was because he had not
      retired to rest the night before. He has done that, however, this time,
      or, at all events, has exchanged his evening-dress for morning-costume.
      Some people do get up at the most premature hours, even in winter, and
      light their own fires, and retrim the midnight lamp to pursue literary or
      scientific labours; but if Captain Lisgard has got up to study, we will
      eat him. What <i>can</i> he be about? He gropes his way down the great
      staircase, where darkness is made visible by streaks of grayish light&mdash;which
      is not yet dawn&mdash;struggling through cracks and crannies; and he
      stumbles over the heavy rug beneath the bottom step, and swears with
      involuntary emphasis. Then he listens a while, to see what will come of
      that. The great clock on the hall-table ticks reprovingly: &ldquo;Don't, don't&mdash;shame,
      shame!&rdquo; as he never heard it tick before; and hear and there breaks forth
      an expostulatory creaking, as though from moral furniture, which has no
      such scruples in the daytime; but his ejaculation has aroused no living
      being.
    </p>
    <p>
      Softly he turns the key of the frontdoor, softly withdraws the bolts, and
      would as softly have slipped out, but that there is suddenly a jar and a
      whir, and the opening door is held fast by an iron hand. &ldquo;Confound the
      chain!&rdquo; exclaims the captain. &ldquo;It is as difficult to get out of this house
      as out of Newgate.&rdquo; Then, when all is still quiet, he emerges upon the
      stone steps with an &ldquo;I wonder, for my part, how burglars are ever
      discovered,&rdquo; and takes his way towards the village. The gates are locked
      at the end of the avenue, and the porter and his wife are doubtless fast
      asleep, as well as fair-haired Polly&mdash;dreaming perhaps of himself,
      thinks the captain with, a half-contemptuous, half-complacent smile&mdash;but
      Master Walter, who is as active as a cat, climbs the stone pillar by help
      of the iron hinge, and &ldquo;drops&rdquo; noiselessly on to the road. He passes up
      the humble street, where each cottage is quiet as the grave&mdash;two
      blessed hours intervening yet between its inmates and their toil, and
      makes for the <i>Lisgard Arms</i>. The inn stands on a slight elevation,
      so that he sees it some time before he nears it. &ldquo;Why, the place is on
      fire!&rdquo; mutters the captain; and certainly there is some extraordinary
      illumination taking place in one of the apartments. A flood of light pours
      from it as from some Pharos, as though to beckon benighted folks whither
      good ale is to be found; and yet the house is always shut at eleven, in
      conformity with the squire's orders.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;It's that infernal idiot Derrick himself who has done it,&rdquo; continues the
      captain. &ldquo;That's his room, I know. Just as if he could not have got up in
      the dark, as I did: a fellow that probably never had more than a
      farthing-dip to light him any morning, before he went to Cariboo. I
      wonder, for my part, he can dress without a valet. What a stuck-up, vulgar
      dog it is! How I hate his pinchbeck ostentation, and still worse, his
      dreadful familiarity! If it could only be found out immediately after this
      Derby that he was a returned transport, with five-and-twenty years or so
      of his sentence still unexpired, how delightful it would be! I really
      think that he is least objectionable in the evenings, when he is drunk.
      There is something original in his brute-manner of swilling; a sort of
      over-driven-ox style about his stagger, which would make his fortune upon
      any stage&mdash;where there was room enough for the magnitude of the
      exhibition. Certainly, one has to pay for the society of this sort of
      gentry, and still more for their friendship. Alas, that I should have made
      this fortunate savage fond of me! I wish I could feel as Valentine did
      with Orson, instead of being much more like the too ingenious
      Frankenstein, whose monster became his master. However, that has not come
      about yet&mdash;notwithstanding meddling Mr Arthur Haldane's warnings.&mdash;Let
      me see, it was arranged, I think, that I was to whistle to this animal.&rdquo;
       Master Walter drew a silver cab-call from his pocket, and executed upon it
      the disconsolate cry of one who in London streets between the closing of
      the night-houses and the rising of the sun desires a Hansom. Instantly the
      light from the inn began to diminish&mdash;once, twice, thrice; and then
      the casement became blind and rayless like the other windows. &ldquo;That beggar
      had four candles lit!&rdquo; ejaculated the captain with irritation. &ldquo;It was a
      mercy that he did not bring out the village fire-engine! Here he comes
      with his eternal pipe, too. I daresay he had the imprudence to light <i>that</i>
      before he left the house, and Steve's red nose will smell it.&rdquo; There are
      some men who always look the same no matter at what hour you come upon
      them: fresh, and hearty, and strong, they have but to duck their heads in
      cold water, and straightway the fatigues of a weary day or a sleepless
      night are utterly obliterated. They rejoice like giants to run their
      courses without any sort of preparation in the way of food and sleep, such
      as the rest of mankind require. Against this healthy animalism we protest,
      by calling it rude health; and to those who are of a less powerful
      constitution, it is naturally an offensive spectacle. Walter Lisgard had
      himself by no means a delicate organisation; his complexion, though pale,
      was far from sickly; his limbs, though models of grace rather than of
      strength, were of good proportions and well knit. But he was conscious of
      looking heavy-eyed and haggard, and he secretly resented the robust and
      florid appearance of the unconscious individual who now joined him&mdash;a
      man at least twenty-five years his senior.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I suppose you have been accustomed to get up at these unearthly hours at
      the gold-diggings, that you look so disagreeably wide-awake, Mr Derrick,&rdquo;
       grumbled he. &ldquo;You would very much oblige me if you would but yawn.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Get up! Master Walter; why, I've never been to bed,&rdquo; answered the bearded
      man with a great guffaw. &ldquo;The fact is, that I took a little more than was
      good for me last night, and I did not dare lie down, knowing that we had
      this business on hand so early.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Why, one would think, by the amount of light, that you had been lying in
      state, like some deceased king of the Cannibal Islands,&rdquo; returned the
      other peevishly. &ldquo;Was it your habit to use two pair of candles in your
      bedroom in Cariboo?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Well, I never had a bedroom there, that you would call such, as I have
      told you again and again, Master Walter; but I have burned twenty candles
      at a time when they were selling at Antler Creek at five dollars a pound.
      You imagine, I suppose, that it is only you gentlemen who live at home at
      ease who have money to spend; but let me tell you that is not the case. I
      will go bail for my part, for example, that I have paid more sovereigns
      away in twenty-four hours than your brother, Sir Richard, ever did in a
      week.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;My dear Mr Derrick, you are boastful this morning,&rdquo; said the captain
      quietly: &ldquo;it is my belief that you have taken a hair of the dog that bit
      you overnight.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Maybe I have, and maybe I haven't, Master Walter; but I shall burn just
      as many candles as I like. I have worked hard enough for my money, and,
      dam'me, but I'll enjoy it. Why, when I was at New Westminster, I had my
      horse shod with gold, sir; and if I choose, I'll do it here.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You would have a perfect right so to do, Mr Derrick,&rdquo; returned the other
      gravely; &ldquo;and for my part, if your horse should cast a shoe in my
      neighbourhood, I should warmly applaud your expensive tastes. But you must
      have been really very rich, to do such things. Now, how much do you think
      you were worth when you were at New Westminster?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;That's tellings, captain,&rdquo; responded the other with a cunning chuckle;
      &ldquo;but when I was on Fraser River, me and my mate Blanquette, we made&rdquo;&mdash;&mdash;&mdash;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Well, now, what <i>did</i> you make?&rdquo; urged the young man, as the other
      hesitated.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Well, we made nothing for the first five days,&rdquo; answered Derrick drily&mdash;&ldquo;nothing
      at all.&mdash;How far have we got to go to reach the Measured Mile by this
      road?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      The two men had left the village, and were pursuing a winding chalk-road
      that led, but not directly, to the Downlands at the back of Mr Chifney's
      stables.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;It is a very circuitous route,&rdquo; returned Master Walter frankly; &ldquo;and I
      was in hopes it might be shortened to the fancy by hearing you tell
      something of your own story. But, of course, I have no wish to press you
      to tell it against your will. You have conferred obligations upon me
      enough already, I am quite aware.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      This was the first sentence of conciliation, not to say of civility, that
      the young man had spoken, and heretofore his air had been cross or
      cynical; yet no sooner did he evince this little of good-will, than the
      manner of the other softened at once to a degree that was very remarkable
      in so rough a man.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Don't talk of obligations, lad, for I like you&mdash;ay, so well, that I
      wish you were son of mine; not that I am fit to be the father of such as
      you either; I <i>know</i> that well.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;If I were your son, I am afraid you would have a good deal of trouble
      with me, Mr Derrick,&rdquo; replied the young man laughing: &ldquo;I am not a good
      boy.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;That is true, Walter Lisgard; and yet I never saw a face that took my
      liking as yours does&mdash;save once. I could not tell what drew me so
      towards you, when I first met you up at the Farm yonder; but now I know
      very well.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Then it is to the similarity between myself and some other favoured
      individual that I am indebted for your regard? That rather robs the
      compliment of its flavour.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Ay, my lad; but you are dear to me for your own sake also, although,
      indeed, I scarce know why.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Thank you, Mr Derrick.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;True,&rdquo; continued the other thoughtfully, without noticing his companion's
      flippant tone, &ldquo;you are like&mdash;ah, Heaven, how like you are to one
      that's dead and gone! Indeed, I can refuse you nothing while I think upon
      it. It is not everybody, however, lad, to whom I would humour by telling
      exactly what I'm worth. While a man is merely known as rich, he may have
      any sum, and be looked up to accordingly; but when his wealth can be
      reckoned to a pound, he loses credit. If <i>Manylaws</i> wins at Epsom, I
      shall be worth&mdash;ay, near a hundred thousand pounds.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I suppose no one in Cariboo ever made a sum like that by gold-digging,
      eh?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I think no one, Master Walter. There was no claim so rich as my mate's
      and mine at Snowy Creek, and it did not yield that sum. But, by Heaven,
      how well I remember what it did yield. It seemed to me then that I should
      never run risks any more, but live on what I had in content and plenty;
      and yet here I am, this very morning&rdquo;&mdash;&mdash;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;My dear sir,&rdquo; interrupted his companion gaily, &ldquo;it appears to me that you
      are taking gloomy views. What is life without excitement?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Ay, that is very well for <i>you</i>, lad, who have something to fall
      back upon, if your little schemes should miscarry. Excitement in your case
      is only another name for amusement; but in mine&rdquo;&mdash;&mdash;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Well, in yours, Mr Derrick?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Do not call me Mister; call me Ralph, lad&mdash;that is, if you are not
      ashamed of me altogether.&mdash;You <i>are</i> ashamed, I see. Well, never
      mind.&mdash;Let me see, I was speaking of Cariboo, was I not? Well,
      success or failure there was a question of life and death. One might be a
      beggar, or one might be the king of the colony. I had known what poverty
      was&mdash;and that is not merely being without money, mind. I have lived
      among a savage people for months who had neither gold nor silver&mdash;nothing
      to hoard and nothing to spend save shells picked up on the sea-shore, and
      strung on sea-weed for a purse; and I was as poor as they; but yet it was
      not poverty. But I had felt the sting of that in many a crowded city, and
      I came to Cariboo to escape from it. If I should make my thousand pounds
      or so, I would buy a farm, or a share in a ship, and live a quiet
      respectable life to the end of my days. While making these good
      resolutions, my ready money&mdash;which was also all I had in the world&mdash;was
      melting fast. With the last ten pounds of it, I bought the half of a small
      claim at Snowy Creek. Blanquette and I sawed our own lumber and made our
      own sluices. It was no light work even for me, who had been used to rough
      it. There was twelve feet of top-stripping to be removed before we could
      hope to reach the pay-dirt. For the first five days, we made nothing. I
      would have sold my share in the whole concern for a couple of pounds, and
      begun life with that afresh; but on the sixth day we found fourteen ounces
      of gold, and I was worth fifty pounds. Then I would not have sold my
      chance for scarcely any sum that you could name. I would have shot any man
      that had jumped into our pit, spade in hand, just as I would have shot a
      dog. Your brother, Sir Richard, may talk about the rights of property, but
      he never appreciated them as I did then. On the seventh day, we found
      forty-five ounces; on the eighth, sixty. The find kept on increasing, till
      it rose to four hundred ounces daily, when we employed eight hands to
      clear away the tailings. The whole area of the place out of which I
      scooped my fortune was not eighty feet by twenty. I found for my share
      twelve thousand pounds in it.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;And you brought that safe to England, did you?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;No, lad, I did not. I spent five hundred pounds of it in champagne&mdash;we
      drank it out of buckets&mdash;for one item.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;And in candles, Ralph,&rdquo; asked Master Walter smiling&mdash;&ldquo;how much in
      candles?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;In one thing and another, dear lad, I spent four thousand pounds before
      we landed in England. Even what was left would have seemed affluence six
      months before&mdash;&mdash;But there, what's the good of talking? There's
      the rubbing-down house, is it not? and I shall soon know whether I am
      going to get a second fortune, or to lose what I have.&rdquo;

      and the long waste of Down stretched far and wide on all sides; a broad
      and level track as smooth as any lawn, with here and there a long but
      gentle slope, marked the exercising-ground used by Mr Chifney's horses.
      This glistened in the early rays like a path of silver. But fringing it on
      one side lay a great patch of gorse, and this quite twinkled with green
      and gold from the gossamers, whose slender fibres covered it as with a
      veil. The air was fresh and odorous with a hundred pleasant scents and in
      the distant vale the morning mists were lifting from field and farm, from
      tower and town, as at the command of some enchanter. Nothing was heard but
      the occasional &ldquo;tink, tink&rdquo; of a sheep-bell from the still sleeping folds.
      It was a scene to charm eye and ear; but Captain Walter Lisgard of the
      104th Dragoons, and Mr Derrick from Cariboo, were persons upon whom the
      Dawn and its concomitants were a good deal thrown away.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You are sure this is the right place?&rdquo; inquired the Colonist as they
      reached a long low-shuttered building, half brick half wood, where the
      horses were wont to be rubbed down after their gallops.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Ay, this is it right enough,&rdquo; was the reply. &ldquo;I dare say they are all
      inside there waiting for us. It does not do to be seen at this sort of
      work. Yes, here they are.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Inside the doorway of the shed in question stood Mr Tite Chifney, in
      company with a gentleman of advanced years, in a white greatcoat and a new
      broad-brimmed hat, somewhat resembling a bishop's.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;How are you, Lisgard?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;How do you do, my Lord?&rdquo; were the only salutations that passed between
      the members of the two parties, who had met entirely upon business.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Come and beat the furze with me, will you, Derrick? the captain has not
      his gaiters on. It is well to make quite sure that we are all alone before
      we begin,&rdquo; said the horse-trainer. The two men accordingly stepped into
      the gorse, and commenced walking through it in parallel lines, as though
      in pursuit of game.
    </p>
    <p>
      When he came to a patch of gorse a little higher and thicker than the
      rest, Mr Chifney struck it violently with his foot as if for rabbits. All
      of a sudden, there was a violent ejaculation from Derrick; he threw
      himself down upon some crouching object, and then came a struggle and a
      choking scream. &ldquo;Hollo, don't kill the fellow,&rdquo; exclaimed Chifney running
      up. &ldquo;See, he's black in the face, man.&mdash;Master Walter, my Lord&mdash;-help,
      here, help!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      The two men who had been left in the rubbing-house came quickly forward,
      but it took the combined strength of all three of them to release the poor
      wretch from the powerful grasp of the Cariboo miner.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Damn the rogue; I 'll teach him to come spying here,&rdquo; cried he, nodding
      with his head towards a shattered telescope, upon which he had just
      stamped his foot. &ldquo;I'll squeeze his throat for him.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You seem to have done that already, sir,&rdquo; said the man in the broad-brim
      coolly; &ldquo;a very little more of it, and you would probably have had <i>your</i>
      throat squeezed for you by the hangman. Poor devil, he doesn't seem to
      have much beside his life belonging to him, so that it would be hard to
      take that.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      A wretched object, clothed in ragged black, and with wisps of straw for
      shoes, wet with the dew amid which he had been lying, and shivering with
      pain and fear, hear crawled to the last speaker's feet.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Don't let 'em murder me, my Lord. They <i>will</i> if you don't
      interfere,&rdquo; screamed the wretched &ldquo;tout,&rdquo; whose mission it was to procure
      racing intelligence under difficulties of this sort, but who had been
      fairly cowed by Derrick's rage and violence. &ldquo;I swear to you that I will
      never tell a soul that I have seen your lordship&rdquo;&mdash;&mdash;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Quiet, fool!&rdquo; interrupted the other sternly, &ldquo;unless you want to have
      your lying tongue cut out.&mdash;It's bad enough,&rdquo; whispered he to the
      trainer, &ldquo;that he should have seen <i>me</i> hear; but do you think he has
      seen the horses?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;That's quite certain, my Lord,&rdquo; returned the trainer coolly; &ldquo;and this is
      a mouth as can't be shut about that matter. But he shall see nothing more
      of this morning's work.&mdash;Come here, you sir.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Taking the trembling wretch by the collar, he led him to the edge of the
      furze, and, having securely tied his arms and legs, enveloped his head in
      a horse-cloth which he brought out of the rubbing-house. From the same
      building there now emerged two horses, not in the clothes in which
      exercise was generally taken, but ready in all respects for racing, and
      ridden not by stable-boys as usual, but by regular jockeys.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;There is no question about it but the bay is the best-looking, my Lord,&rdquo;
       said the trainer, in answer to something that had been addressed to him;
      &ldquo;but handsome is as handsome does. You would not thank me for praising <i>The
      King</i> on Epsom Downs, after he had been beaten by an outsider such as
      yonder horse.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Who rides the creature?&rdquo; inquired the other sharply, and looking
      contemptuously towards the clumsy black, who was no other than our old
      friend <i>Menelaus</i>. &ldquo;Dam'me if he don't look more fit for a hearse
      than a race-course.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Jack Withers, my Lord&mdash;a man that was with him in France, and
      thoroughly understands what the horse can do; and, indeed, there is no
      other that <i>can</i> ride him as should be. That's the worst of these
      foreign horses&mdash;they are so full of tricks. I've known that black
      stand stock-still in his gallops, and shoot his boy off just like a
      rocket. He can't abide a strange seat.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Of course Withers rides him in the great race,&rdquo; observed the other
      thoughtfully.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Certainly, my Lord, just as Tom Uxbridge here will mount <i>The King</i>.
      What's the good of having a trial-race unless with the same jocks as is to
      ride them afterwards?&mdash;Starting from that white post, up the rise
      yonder, round the fir clump, and so back again, is the Derby course to a
      yard.&mdash;Master Walter and Mr Derrick, will you be so good-as to bear a
      hand, and help me out with the steps?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Ain't the gentleman in the broad-brim going to use them as well as me?&rdquo;
       observed the Colonist insolently, and keeping his hands resolutely in his
      pockets. &ldquo;I never engaged myself to be his body-servant, as I know on.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      There being no answer to this appeal, Captain Lisgard and the trainer once
      more entered the rubbing-house, and reappeared dragging with them a
      movable platform upon wheels, and furnished with a flight of steps after
      the manner of a pulpit. From the top of this, one might see the whole
      course from end to end, and upon it the four spectators took their station
      close to the starting-post.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Now, my lads, are you both ready?&rdquo; inquired the trainer of the jockeys,
      who were getting their fuming horses into line. &ldquo;This handkerchief will
      serve for a flag, and when I drop it, let there he no false starts. One,
      two, three&mdash;now off!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      As the handkerchief left his fingers, the bay and black leaped forward as
      with a single impulse; the next moment each had got into his stride, and
      was away like the wind.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;It is amazing how they keep together,&rdquo; muttered his Lordship in an uneasy
      tone: &ldquo;I should not have thought the Frenchman had had such speed in him.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;It is the hill which will decide the matter, my Lord,&rdquo; returned the
      trainer in a low tone; &ldquo;the ground is rising already. There! and see, the
      black draws ahead.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Ay, the black has it!&rdquo; cried Derrick with a frightful imprecation. &ldquo;I
      will lay fifty-pounds to ten on <i>Manylaws</i>.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I take you, sir,&rdquo; said the man in the broad-brim coolly, as with
      race-glass in hand he watched every movement of the horses who were now
      nearing the fir-clump: &ldquo;there has something happened to that big-boned
      animal of yours, I fear. What is it, Chifney?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      He was about to pass the glass to the trainer, but Derrick roughly tore it
      from his grasp, and applied it to his own eyes. &ldquo;It's one of his infernal
      jibs,&rdquo; exclaimed he; &ldquo;and yet&mdash;&mdash; Well done, Jack Withers;
      that's a five-pound note in your pocket.&mdash;Perhaps you'd like to look
      again, my Lord, for their position is a little altered.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;The black is gaining fast,&rdquo; ejaculated Captain Lisgard, his pale face
      aglow with excitement. &ldquo;He has recovered all he lost by that false step.
      What a pace they are coming down the hill! By Heaven, <i>The King</i> is
      beaten! Tom is using the whip.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Just what I expected,&rdquo; murmured the trainer.
    </p>
    <p>
      There was a thunder of hoofs, the smack of a whip again and again, a flash
      of colour&mdash;first black, then bay&mdash;and the trial-race was over.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;In a second and a half less time than the last Derby,&rdquo; said his Lordship
      drily, after consulting his stop-watch.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I think I did not bring you here for nothing, my Lord,&rdquo; said the trainer
      confidentially.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Certainly not, Mr Chifney,&rdquo; returned the other bitterly: &ldquo;I find myself a
      poorer man than I had thought to be three minutes ago by fifty thousand
      pounds. Moreover, I have made the acquaintance of one of the greatest
      ruffians that I have ever met even upon a race-course. It is altogether an
      excellent morning's work.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;It would have been worse for you, my Lord, if you had not come,&rdquo; answered
      the trainer with some stiffness; &ldquo;you would not have thanked me if you had
      seen this for the first time on Epsom Downs.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Very true&mdash;very true, Mr Chifney. But you must excuse my feeling a
      little annoyed by the results of this gallop. And as for this gentleman
      with the beard&mdash;when he has done shaking his hands with his jockey&mdash;&mdash;
      Here are two five-pound notes for you, sir&mdash;the amount of my bet.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Keep it yourself, my Lord,&rdquo; exclaimed Derrick, waving his hat round and
      round in frantic joy. &ldquo;Or stay, if you're too proud.&mdash;Here, Jack, is
      a fiver for you; and here, you poor devil in the horse-cloth, here's
      another for you, to heal your windpipe, which, I believe, I squeezed a
      little too hard a while ago. If the race had gone agen me, you'd never
      have got a shilling of compensation, so you may thank <i>Manylaws</i>.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      The trainer's hand was clapped upon the incautious gold-digger's mouth
      with considerable emphasis, but it arrived too late. &ldquo;The cat was out of
      the bag.&rdquo; The tout had learned the very piece of intelligence to obtain
      which he had gone through so much.
    </p>
    <p>
      Bound and bruised, and in evil plight as he was, the fellow could not help
      indulging in a sly chuckle, while his four enemies (for the jockeys were
      already in the rubbing-down house attending to their panting steeds)
      regarded one another with looks of blank dismay.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You have done it now, Mr Derrick,&rdquo; observed the trainer lugubriously. &ldquo;We
      shall never get thirty to one&mdash;no, nor ten to one&mdash;against <i>Menelaus</i>
      again.&mdash;Great Heaven! why, you wouldn't kill the man!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      The gold-digger had drawn a clasp-knife, half dagger, half cutting-tool,
      from his pocket, and was quietly feeling the point of it with his thumb.
      &ldquo;I have done wrong,&rdquo; said he, &ldquo;but it is a wrong which is not without
      remedy. No, I am not going to murder this gentleman&mdash;at least not
      now; but I have something of importance to tell him.&mdash;Look you here,
      Mr Tout. I am not a respectable person any more than yourself, in a
      general way; but there is probably this difference between us&mdash;I am a
      man of my word. What I <i>say</i>, I will do, I always <i>do</i> do, at
      all hazards. If a man robs another of his gold in the place where I come
      from, we shoot him: it mayn't be right, but that is the principle on which
      we act. You will rob me of all I have in the world if you tell what you
      have seen to-day; consequently, mark me, if you do tell, <i>I will kill
      you</i>. Of this you may be well assured. That is the only satisfaction
      which will be left me. You have felt my fingers, but you will in that case
      feel this knife. I hope I make myself well understood&mdash;&mdash; No,
      Master Walter, this is not your business, but a private matter between
      this person and myself. I want to take a good look at him, so that I may
      know him again anywhere; alone or in company, in England or across seas;
      let him be sure I shall find him out; and I want him to take a good look
      at me. Mine is not the face of a man who falters in his purpose, or who,
      having suffered a wrong, puts up with it, I think, and does not revenge
      himself.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      He knelt down, and set his bearded cheek quite close to the luckless tout.
      Each looked into the other's eyes&mdash;one inquiringly, with a
      half-timid, half-cunning glance; the other sternly, vengefully, like a
      judge and executioner in one.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I will never tell!&rdquo; quavered the miserable wretch&mdash;&ldquo;s'help me,
      Heaven, I never will!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes, you will,&rdquo; returned Derrick coolly; &ldquo;I can see that you are a
      babbler born; and I don't ask impossibilities. Moreover, it is but just
      that you should derive some advantage from my folly. In a week's time, you
      may tell your employer what you please. In the meanwhile, there is your
      five pounds. I wish to act as fairly by you as I can; but if the odds rise
      or fall respecting these two horses within seven days&mdash;as they can
      only do if the result of this trial gets wind&mdash;then I shall know
      where to find a sheath for this knife.&rdquo; With these words he cut the rope
      that bound the man's arms and legs, pushed the five-pound note into his
      hands, and bade him be off; whereupon off he shambled.
    </p>
    <p>
      Neither the trainer nor the man addressed as &ldquo;my Lord&rdquo; had stirred or
      spoken a word during this interview, and Captain Lisgard had only once
      made a movement as though to interrupt it. All three were well enough
      pleased that the gold-digger had taken the task of imposing silence into
      his own hands. In all likelihood, he was merely threatening the fellow;
      and if not, they did not wish to be accessories before the fact to&mdash;to
      any vengeance he might choose to inflict upon the offending tout.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Well, gentlemen, we have now six clear days wherein to make our
      arrangements,&rdquo; said Derrick, &ldquo;and a good deal may be done in that time.
      True, but for my stupid conduct, we might have had more time before us;
      but I have made what amends lies in my power.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You believe, then, that yonder rascal will keep his word, do you?&rdquo;
       inquired the trainer incredulously.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I think so, Mr Chifney. I shall certainly keep mine,&rdquo; returned the other
      gravely.&mdash;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Master Walter, we had better be moving home.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      At these words, the party separated&mdash;like men who have each their
      work to do, and are glad to be quit of their companions, in order that
      they may set about it&mdash;with no more ceremony than a parting nod. The
      man in the broad-brim rode away upon a shooting-pony, which awaited him in
      the rubbing-down house. The jockeys paced slowly towards their stables,
      each horse now clothed and visored as though it had been merely out for
      early exercise; while Mr Chifney walked briskly homeward by another route.
    </p>
    <p>
      Derrick and Captain Lisgard returned together by the way they came, and
      plodded on for some time in total silence.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You will put all your money upon the black un now, I fancy, Master
      Walter?&rdquo; observed the gold-digger at last, as they drew near the village.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I have done that already,&rdquo; replied the young man frankly. &ldquo;I was thinking
      rather of hedging when the odds fall.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Nay, do not do that, lad,&rdquo; rejoined the other earnestly; &ldquo;the thing is a
      certainty. <i>The King</i> was the only horse that we had to fear. On the
      contrary, my advice is, 'Put the Pot on.'&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;The Pot <i>is</i> on, with all I have to put in it, Mr Derrick. You
      forget that I am not an eldest son, and nobody lends money to a younger.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Ay, true; there's that confounded stuck-up coxcomb, Sir Richard. But look
      here, my lad. In this pocket-book I carry all I am worth in the world, for
      in Cariboo there are no banks, and a man at my time of life does not
      readily change his habits. Here are five hundred pounds entirely at your
      service. Nay, I told you that I had taken a liking to you, and I would
      give them to you right-away, only I suppose you are too proud to accept
      them, save as a loan.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Mr Derrick&mdash;Ralph&mdash;you are very, very kind,&rdquo; said the young man
      hesitatingly; &ldquo;but this is a large sum.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;At the present prices, it is ten thousand pounds if <i>Manylaws</i>
      wins,&rdquo; replied the gold-digger, rubbing his hands; &ldquo;and if <i>Manylaws</i>
      does not win&mdash;well, I shall not, I hope, be an importunate creditor.
      I do not say: 'Do not thank me,' lad, or I like you to smile like that.
      You are very, very welcome. But here we part; you to your home and
      friends, and I&mdash;well, I am used to be alone. I shall not see a
      friend's face again till I see yours. Good-bye, dear lad, good-bye.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      With a hearty hand-shake and more thanks, Master Walter strode gaily away
      through the still slumbering village, reclimbed the avenue gate, and let
      himself noiselessly in at the front-door. As he passed on tiptoe along a
      gallery, on one side of which lay his sister's apartment, and on the other
      that of Miss Rose Aynton's, a door opened, and an anxious voice whispered:
      &ldquo;What news, Walter?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Good news,&rdquo; replied he in the same cautious tone, and glided on to his
      own room.

    <h2>
      CHAPTER XIII. AT SIR ROBERT'S GRAVE.
    </h2>
    <p class="pfirst">
      <span class="dropcap" style="font-size: 4.00em">I</span>T had been
      observed, as I have already said, that my Lady had not left the Abbey
      grounds for these many weeks; but there had been one exception to that
      course of conduct. She had never omitted to visit, as usual, her late
      husband's grave, and to lay upon it a posy of spring-flowers, gathered by
      her own hands; but she did this now in the evening, instead of the
      daytime, as heretofore. It was not, however, likely that any intruder
      should be found there at any hour.
    </p>
    <p>
      Whoever of the household saw her walking in the direction of the little
      church&mdash;only a stone's-throw from the servants' offices&mdash;took
      great care to avoid her, or to appear, if they needs must meet her,
      unconscious of her errand; and while she was there, no domestic used the
      little zigzag path among the grass-grown graves that formed the short-cut
      to the village. The country folk were forbidden at all times to approach
      the Abbey by that way, so the sacred spot was almost as private as though
      it had been an appendage of the Abbey itself, as it had been in the old
      times. Mirk lay quite out of the high-road, so that no stranger
      &ldquo;stretching his legs,&rdquo; while the coach changed horses, ever strolled into
      its God's-acre to spend a profitless five minutes amid its solemn records;
      nor, indeed, was there anything in the graveground, whatever might have
      been in the church, to attract such persons, in the way of monument or
      effigy. Yet the humble graves were all well kept; not broken or dinted in,
      as one too often sees them in such places; nor did the head-stones lean
      this way and that, as though they strove to wrench up the very mounds they
      were set to mark; nor were the long rank grasses and the nettles permitted
      to overgrow the spot, and hide it from the sun. Upon every slab, however,
      save one, time was doing its work, covering with moss and lichen the gray
      surface, and filling up the letters on the stones&mdash;-just as in the
      hearts of the survivors it was healing the sense of loss, and effacing the
      memory of the departed one. The sole exception was the stone which
      commemorated Sir Robert's death. His marble cross was without speck or
      flaw. It stood in the western corner, in a little plot of garden-ground of
      its own, and beside it was a vacant space, left there by his widow's
      desire, that she might herself be laid there when God's good time should
      come.

    <p>
      It is the evening of the day upon which Master Walter got up so early, and
      my Lady has come, as usual, to her husband's tomb. Her hand is resting on
      the top of it, whereon she has just hung a chaplet of fresh-gathered
      flowers; but her look is fixed upon the western sky, where the glory of
      the sunken sun yet lingers. It may be but a simple faith that associates
      Heaven with the sky, but it is a very natural one. My Lady's soul was
      longing to be at rest somewhere beyond those quiet clouds which flecked
      that golden deep. Death is not so invariably hateful to us as the divines
      would paint it; it has no terrors for the Good&mdash;nay, sometimes not
      for the Bad either&mdash;while to the Wretched it would often be more
      welcome than the dawn. &ldquo;If I could only 'fall asleep,' as is said of the
      saints,&rdquo; thought my Lady, &ldquo;here, and at this instant, how well for all
      would it be! Some only live for others, they say, but the best that could
      possibly happen to all I love would be that I should be laid in my grave.
      And some have died for others, as God knows I would die for any one of my
      dear ones, and yet it would be sin in me to die. Ah, husband, husband!
      thou that liest here under the flowers and the sky, I would to Heaven that
      I could lie down beside thee now, and never wake! I trust thou dost not
      know this thing that troubles me, and threatens mine and thine, or thy
      dear heart would be wrung with pity, although thou wert an angel and in
      eternal bliss. And but that the Almighty has fixed his canon against
      self-slaughter&mdash;&mdash; Those were happy days in which I first read
      that!&rdquo; mused she, interrupting herself, and carried involuntarily into
      another current of thought; &ldquo;we read it together, you and I, Robert. My
      new life was just beginning then; never had pupil such a kindly teacher as
      thou wert. I can bear to think of that; but of thy love, thy noble
      generous love, thy patient tenderness&mdash;&mdash;&mdash; Spare me, great
      Heaven! I did so worship this dead man, and now I live alone; and yet I
      would not have him here alive, to know what I know, to feel what I feel,
      to dread what I dread&mdash;no, not though we should be permitted to live
      together for years, and die within the selfsame hour, as I used to pray we
      might. I thank thee, merciful God, that I am bearing this heavy cross
      alone; give me strength to carry it, and suffer me to do so&mdash;if it
      please thee&mdash;to the end, alone. It is my fault, husband; all mine.
      When you pressed me to marry you, and I said 'No,' I should have said it
      more firmly. We were not fit for one another.&mdash;No, no; not that! I
      will not say that. You made me what I am; a wife fit for yourself, I do
      believe; not good, like you&mdash;not wise, like you&mdash;but one who was
      a faithful and true helpmate, and with whom you were content. If you could
      make a sign to me from the earth, or in the air, this moment, I should not
      be afraid but that it would be one of love. If you, perchance, have come
      to know every thought in my heart that was in your time&mdash;or if you
      have read it since you died&mdash;or if you read it now&mdash;still I
      should not be afraid! I will endeavour to do my duty still; but ah! how
      foolish are they who say we always know what <i>is</i> our duty! O Robert,
      what is mine?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      She wrung her hands in pitiful distraction, and throwing herself down by
      the graveside, whispered, as though to the deaf ear beneath: &ldquo;The sea has
      given up its dead to shame me, and thy children, because of me. What is
      there for me to do for them except to die?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Hollo, missus! what's wrong wi' <i>you?</i>&rdquo; inquired a deep hoarse
      voice. &ldquo;Drunk or sober, I never could abide seeing a woman cry.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      At such a time and place, the sudden and unexpected interruption might
      well have sent a shudder, to any woman's heart, and it was no wonder that
      my Lady trembled in every limb. But she gathered herself together with a
      great effort, and drawing her thick crape veil over her face, arose, and
      steadily confronted the intruder.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Why, it's my Lady herself!&rdquo; cried the new-comer derisively&mdash;&ldquo;the
      party as I've promised myself a good look at before I left these diggings.
      And, dam'me, but now I'll have it. If I'm anyways rude, you will please to
      put it down to the brandy in which I have been drinking to the very good
      health of the big black horse. Now, don't be so cursedly proud; your son
      and I&mdash;not Sir Richard, for he's a&mdash;&mdash; Well, you're his
      mother, so I won't say what I was agoing to about <i>him</i>; but Master
      Walter, he and I are great friends.&mdash;Now, why do you wince? <i>He</i>
      ain't so high and mighty but that he can borrow money of your humble
      servant; but there&mdash;there's no obligation in that, for I love the
      lad. He's like&mdash;like a dear friend of mine, who was drowned in the
      sea, years and years ago. Lord, how you do tremble! Why, I'm the last man
      in the world to hurt a woman, bless you. My nature is altogether soft
      where they're concerned; and if it were not so, there was a woman once, my
      Lady, drowned and dead&mdash;the same as I was speaking of&mdash;for whose
      sake every woman since has been in my eyes sort of sacred-like; that is,
      unless I was in drink.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      It was painfully evident to my Lady that the person who was speaking to
      her was in the unhappy condition he had just referred to, for he lurched
      from side to side until he had bethought him of steadying himself by the
      marble cross; but there was a sort of pathos in his voice, too, which was
      not the mere maudlin tenderness of the drunkard. If he had not been drunk,
      he might not have been tender, but there was evidently genuine feeling in
      the man, which seemed to deepen as he went on. &ldquo;Now, though you do not
      speak, I know you're sorry for me. If I should lift your veil&mdash;there,
      I'm not agoing to do it&mdash;I am sure you would have a tear for a poor
      fellow who has been knocked about the world for three parts of his life,
      and has not made a single friend&mdash;not one, not one; and if he went
      back home, who would not see a face he knew&mdash;it is so long ago that
      he was there&mdash;and who needs a woman's voice to comfort him if ever a
      man did.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;What's all this to me, sir?&rdquo; asked my Lady in low and broken tones. &ldquo;I
      wish to be left alone here&mdash;by this grave.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;What&mdash;is&mdash;all&mdash;this&mdash;to you?&rdquo; returned the man with
      vindictive deliberation, &ldquo;Have you no heart, then, you proud woman, like
      your eldest son?&rdquo; Then once more altering his manner, he continued: &ldquo;Now,
      do not be angry with me, or you may be sorry for it, but rather pity me.
      This grave contains what is dear to you, it seems; but you have those
      alive who love you also! Now, I have not even a grave. The only creature
      on earth who ever loved <i>me</i>&mdash;and I loved her too, ah how
      dearly, though I could not keep even then from drink&mdash;she lies buried
      beneath the stormy waves. I cannot come, as you can, to this tomb, and
      say: 'Here she sleeps,' and weep over it, and be sorry for my sins, for I
      know not where, in all the waste of ocean, her bones may lie. So, for many
      years I never looked upon the sea without the sense that I was looking
      upon one great grave. Am I speaking truth or not?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      He stopped and clutched her by the arm, and fiercely bade her tell him if
      she believed his words or no.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I do believe you, sir,&rdquo; returned my Lady firmly. &ldquo;Beneath your bronzed
      and bearded face, I see your woes at work, and I am sorry for you.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Thank you, Lady; you have a pleasant and kind voice, with music in it
      such as I have not heard for many a day. You are sorry for me, but you
      know not half my woes; I have never told them to any human ear; although
      at times, when I have been all alone&mdash;upon the treeless prairie, not
      knowing whether I was on the right track or lost, or on the mountain-top
      in strange and savage lands, and chiefly when a solitary man on shipboard,
      keeping watch while others slept&mdash;then have I spoken of these things
      aloud, and asked of Heaven why it used me so. But now&mdash;as some black
      cloud will overpass a mighty plain, and never shed a drop, but presently,
      on coming on a little valley fenced with round green hills, will straight,
      dissolve in rain, so I, who have been so silent for so long, am moved to
      speak by you. What magic is this you bear about you, woman? Let me see
      your face.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;There is no need for that, sir,&rdquo; answered my Lady, stepping back, and
      motioning with her arm with dignity. &ldquo;The magic of which you speak lies
      only in a feeling heart and an attentive ear. If it is any comfort to you
      to tell your story, I will gladly listen to it.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes, it seems to be a comfort,&rdquo; replied the other thoughtfully, &ldquo;although
      I never cared to speak of it before. You see me, Lady, now, a brawling,
      drunken wretch&mdash;upon whose reckless soul there may be murder,
      to-morrow or next day, as like as not&mdash;but anyhow a broken man. I was
      not always thus. When I was young, I was a hopeful and hard-working lad
      enough&mdash;only a little thoughtless. I was honest, too, notwithstanding
      that the law and I fell out; but I was fond of jovial company and good
      liquor, and what I got at sea&mdash;for I had a smack of my own at
      Bleamouth&mdash;that I spent very quickly on shore. If I had had a wife,
      or even a mother, I think it might have been different; but I had no
      relations, or at least none who were my friends. I could not bear advice,
      and much less interference and dictation, and so, you see, I was alone in
      the world&mdash;until I met with Lucy Meade&mdash;&mdash; You shiver, my
      Lady. Am I keeping you too long in the night-air?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Lady Lisgard shook her head, and murmured: &ldquo;No; go on.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;'Tis thirty years ago this very year&mdash;that's many thousand days, and
      tens of thousand leagues have I sailed since then&mdash;and yet, I swear,
      it seems but yesterday I crossed those water-meadows with my gun&mdash;for
      I was after moorfowl&mdash;and came upon her cottage on the Blea.
      White-walled, white-roofed&mdash;for in those parts they paint them so&mdash;it
      nestled under a rocky hill, crested with heather; and in front the river
      ran, swollen with recent rains, through a broad weedy flat, and so,
      between the rounded sand-hills, to the sea. Before the cottage was a porch
      with honeysuckles trained upon it, and one full-flowering fuchsia upon
      either side. Then, as I drew near, I saw her sitting in the porch mending
      her father's net. Ah, Heaven, I see her now!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      The speaker paused and sighed; but looking out into the viewless air, as
      if upon some picture hung in space, he did not mark my Lady start and
      clasp her hands, as though some dreadful thing had come upon her suddenly,
      against which none could help her but only God alone.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;It is a story, Lady Lisgard, that you doubtless know,&rdquo; continued the man,
      &ldquo;for even among lords and ladies love will come. I asked her for a drink
      of water, and she brought me with it Hope, Resolve, Repentance&mdash;I
      know not what. From that moment forth, I lived my life anew. Then the next
      day, and the next, I sought the cottage; and when I had won my way with
      Lucy&mdash;that was her name, my Lady&mdash;did I tell you?&mdash;I
      pleaded my cause with the old fisherman, her father&mdash;her mother being
      already ours&mdash;but for a long time in vain.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;She was his only child, his only prop and stay, and he was proud of her,
      as well he might have been, for she was gentle of speech as you yourself
      or any lady born, and scholarly and wise beyond her humble state, and,
      young as she was, already had had many a suitor; but she had never loved
      but me. 'Tis like enough you cannot fancy that; but then my former self
      was not like this.&rdquo; He pointed to his heart with a scornful gesture, as
      though something loathsome had taken the place of what had wont to be
      there.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Besides, the fairest, purest creature upon earth was she, and she took
      all things for pure. Not that there was much against me either, except
      that I loved good liquor; besides, I only drank for pleasure then, and now&mdash;&mdash;
      But let that be. Well, we were married. We lived with the old couple at
      the cottage, as Lucy wished, partly for their sakes, partly, as I have
      often thought since then, for mine&mdash;that I might be kept out of bad
      company, such as there was plenty of at Bleamouth at that time &mdash;poachers,
      smugglers, and idlers of all sorts. But this was done too late. I have
      said that the Law and I fell out: that was for poaching &mdash;and Curse
      the law, say I, which rich men make for the poor perforce to break. I
      never poached after I married, but before that time I had shot a hare or
      two; and once&mdash;but months ago&mdash;there had been a fray with
      keepers, and I had clubbed my gun, and struck my hardest, like the rest.
      There had been broken bones on both sides, but the matter had blown over,
      as I thought, when all of a sudden I received certain news that I was
      marked for one of the offenders, and that men were coming to take me from
      my Lucy's arms to jail. I told her this, for I had kept nothing from her
      all along, and I knew that she had courage, or she would never have
      married such a man as me; but I forgot, in my selfish roughness, that it
      is one thing to be brave in things that concern one's self, and another to
      be able to bear to see others suffer. 'Ah, Heaven!' exclaimed she, 'but
      this will kill my father! To have his honest house entered by men in
      search of felons, and to see his daughter's husband with the gyves upon
      him&mdash;that will be his death, I know.' The auld wife said so likewise.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;They were right, I think, for when we came to break the thing to him, and
      warn him of what might happen, although all was said to excuse what I had
      done, and to soften the consequences that might come of it, he raved like
      one distracted. 'Let him leave my cottage!' cried he; 'he has worked
      mischief enough already; he has robbed me of my daughter's love, and now
      he would take from me my good name. Let him leave this honest roof!' 'But
      where he goes, I must go, father,' replied Lucy, with her arms about the
      old man's neck; and in the end he was brought to see that it must be so.
      So I changed my name to that of Derrick, which I bear now, and fled from
      home to a great seaport, and there, on board an emigrant-ship bound for
      the other side of the world, took passage not only for myself and wife,
      but for her parents. It was agreed that all were to begin life again in a
      strange land, so that I, too, might begin it once more with that fair
      start which I had lost in my own country. Thus the poor old man and his
      wife were torn from the comfortable home that had sheltered them for half
      a century, and forced in their old age to cross the seas. No, not to cross
      them: would to Heaven they might have been suffered so to do! It was
      ordained that I, who had thus far caused their wretchedness, should also
      be the means of their death. A most terrible storm overtook us at
      midnight, while yet in sight of lights on English land, and in the midst
      of it our vessel sprung a leak. I knew that I had a brave woman for my
      wife, but then I found she was a heroine; I knew my Lucy was good as she
      was fair, but then she proved herself an angel. There were men on board
      who screamed and wailed like children. She never uttered a cry or shed a
      tear. She felt that she was going to heaven with all she loved (for she
      always thought the best of every one), and therefore death had no terrors
      for her. But I&mdash;I felt myself a murderer. I did what I could to save
      the two old people, and got them into the only boat that left the ship;
      but it had not parted from us twice its length, before it capsized before
      our eyes. Lucy had refused to leave me, and when the vessel began to sink,
      I lashed her to a spar, and then myself; and so for a little time we
      floated. But the great waves drenched us through and through, and dashed
      upon us so that we had hardly time to breathe. The spar was not large
      enough for both our weights, which sank it too low in the water; and so I
      secretly unloosed the cords that fastened me, and clambered to my Lucy's
      side, and kissed her cold wet cheek, and whispered: 'Fare well, Lucy.'&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Here the speaker paused, and covered his rough face. My Lady, too, was
      deeply moved. For near a minute, neither spoke. Then the man resumed: &ldquo;I
      slipped into the sea, and struck out aimlessly enough, but with the
      instinct of a swimmer. Fool that I was to wish to live!&rdquo; Again he paused;
      but this time, to mutter an execration.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;And did not all your care and unselfish love suffice to save her?&rdquo; asked
      the listener tenderly.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;No, Lady. She was drowned. I never expected otherwise in such a sea. The
      whole ship's company were lost, except myself. When nearly spent, I came
      upon a huge piece of the wreck, and held on to it till daylight, when I
      found myself at sea. I would to God that it had not been so! I was nearer
      Heaven at that time than I have ever been since, and I ought to have
      perished then, when all which made life precious had already gone: it
      would have been far better to have died with her, than to live without
      her. But I did live. After two days and three nights of hunger and thirst,
      a vessel picked me up, a sodden mass of rags, half-dead and half-mad. They
      nursed me and made me well&mdash;it was a cruel kindness&mdash;and after
      many days, I was able to tell them what had happened. 'Ay, then,' said
      they, 'the pilot was right who came to us off Falmouth. It was the <i>North
      Star</i> that went to pieces in the storm; you are the sole survivor, man,
      of all on board. Nothing came on shore that night, or could have come on
      such a coast as that, save spars and corpses.'&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      There was silence for a minute's space: the strong man's chest laboured in
      vain to give him breath for utterance; in vain his horny hand dashed the
      big tears from his brown cheeks; they still rained on.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Alas, poor man!&rdquo; said my Lady, in a broken and pitiful voice, &ldquo;I feel for
      you from my very soul. And when you found your three-weeks' bride was dead&mdash;I
      think you said you had married her but three weeks&mdash;what then became
      of <i>you?</i>&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;What matters?&rdquo; asked the man half-angrily, &ldquo;It mattered nothing even to
      myself. The vessel took me&mdash;it was all one to me whither she was
      bound&mdash;to New South Wales. And in the New World I did indeed begin a
      new life&mdash;but it was a far worse one than in the old, I was reckless,
      hopeless already, and I was not long in becoming Godless. When that is
      said, a man's history is the same, wherever he lives, whatever he does,
      and however he ends.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      He stamped his foot upon the ground, as though he would keep down some
      rising demon, and his voice once more resumed the hoarseness it had
      exchanged for something almost plaintive throughout his story.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Ralph, Ralph,&rdquo; began my Lady reprovingly, and touching his rough sailor's
      sleeve with her gloved hand&mdash;&mdash;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;And how the devil should you know my name is Ralph?&rdquo; interrupted the
      other in blank amazement.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;My maid, Mary Forest, told me it was Ralph,&rdquo; returned my Lady calmly.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Did she? Well, that's no reason why <i>you</i> should call me by it.
      However, since you seem to feel so unexpected an interest in your humble
      servant, I will make bold to ask a favour of you.&rdquo; His manner was rough
      and defiant as ever now, like that of a sturdy vagrant soliciting alms of
      a defenceless woman.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You are angry with yourself,&rdquo; said my Lady quietly, &ldquo;for having given way
      to feelings which do you honour; that is a base sort of regret indeed. You
      try to persuade yourself that I have affected a sympathy which I did not
      feel, but you do not succeed. I cannot but be interested in one who, with
      all his faults, has certainly in the hour of death and danger behaved
      nobly, and who must, I feel assured, have the seeds of good in him yet,
      despite his wild and despairing talk.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;No, woman, I have not,&rdquo; returned the man with vehemence. &ldquo;Dismiss that
      from your mind at once. Ralph Derrick is no hypocrite, whatever he is, and
      he tells you now that he is a lost man, in the sense which such as you
      understand it. I don't know why I have spoken to you as I have done just
      now&mdash;some springs of feeling that I had deemed were quite dried up
      flowed at your voice as they have not done these thirty years&mdash;but
      don't imagine that I am soft-hearted. I am not a bad fellow when I'm
      sober, and not put out; but then I'm seldom sober, and I'm very easily put
      out. Your son, Sir Richard, has put me out, for one. I should be sorry for
      him if he and I had much to do with one another.&mdash;But there, you need
      not turn so pale; for, for your sake&mdash;and for Master Walter's sake,
      who has got my Lucy's eyes, and look, and voice, God bless him&mdash;Sir
      Richard is safe from me; albeit I have let fly a bullet before now at men
      who have wronged me less than he has done&mdash;an insolent young devil!
      It was a man like him, one of your landowners, forsooth, whose persecution
      drove me from my native shore, and drowned my wife and the old couple.
      Damn all such tyrants, says Ralph Derrick&rdquo;&mdash;&mdash;
    </p>
    <p>
      It was difficult to associate the depressed and solemn speaker of a few
      minutes back with this passionate and lawless man, his huge fingers
      opening and shutting in nervous excitement, his eyeballs suffused with
      blood, and each hair of his vast beard, as it seemed, bristling with
      vengeful fury.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You were saying that you wished to ask a favour of me, Mr Derrick?&rdquo;
       interposed my Lady quietly. &ldquo;What is it I can do for you?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Well, you can do this,&rdquo; returned he roughly: &ldquo;you can cease to set your
      waiting-maid, Mary, against me, as you have hitherto done. I am not a bad
      match for her, as she knows, in point of money; and if she finds herself
      able to put up with little starts of temper, and not to grudge me a drop
      o' drink at times, why, what is that to you?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Have you told her, may I ask, of what you have been telling <i>me</i>, Mr
      Derrick?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes; at least I told her I was a widower; I never felt a call to tell her
      more; she would not understand, look you. She asked me what this leaden
      locket was I wear about my neck, with this poor broken piece of stick in
      it, and something withered clinging to it still, and I told her it was a
      charm against the ague. Now, you&mdash;I'll wager you can tell me what it
      holds.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;No, not I. How should <i>I</i> know?&rdquo; inquired my Lady hurriedly.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You <i>do</i> know, anyway. This fellow is not the sort of man to carry
      charms, you think; and all that's sacred to him in the world or out of it
      hangs on his love that's drowned. This, then, must be some token&mdash;were
      there not fuchsias upon either side the porch where first they met? There,
      now, you have it, I can see.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You plucked, perhaps, a piece of fuchsia when you plighted troth,&rdquo;
       murmured my Lady.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Ay, when we plighted troth,&rdquo; answered the other mournfully; &ldquo;and breaking
      a twig in twain, all blossoming then, but now&mdash;see, dried to dust&mdash;each
      kept a half. I have seen far up the hills in Mexico a piece of the true
      Cross, that's held to be the richest possession that the Church calls her
      own in those parts; well, that's not sure; it may be or it mayn't be what
      they term it; but this poor twig has never been out of my sight or reach,
      and so I kiss and worship this, my relic, as no devotee can do.&mdash;Now,
      what would Mary Forest say to that? She is not like my Lucy; no, indeed,
      no more than I am like the Ralph of those old days; and if she were,
      should I be fit for her? My Lucy married to a drunken, gambling ruffian!
      Tis blasphemy to think upon it. But as for this wench, your waiting-maid,
      she and I are suited well enough. She wants a husband, and is willing to
      take me; while I, who have been tossed so long on the stormy billows of
      life, shall be glad to come to anchor. It is you only&mdash;she told me so
      herself&mdash;who stand in the way.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;And would you have me, then, advise this woman&mdash;being my faithful
      friend as well as my servant&mdash;to unite her fortunes with a man who,
      from his own lips I learn, is hopeless, reckless, Godless, a drunkard and
      a gambler&rdquo;&mdash;&mdash;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Hell and Furies!&rdquo; broke forth the other impatiently, &ldquo;will you dare to
      use what I have just now told you against myself! Beware, beware, proud
      woman, how you cross a desperate man! Since my life is worthless, as you
      paint it, you may be sure that I shall hold the risk of losing it lighter
      than better men: there is nothing that I dare not do to those who cross
      me.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I have no fear for myself, sir, and least of all things, Ralph Derrick,
      do I fear death,&rdquo; answered my Lady calmly. &ldquo;Yet willingly I promise that I
      will never breathe one syllable to human ear of what you have said
      to-night.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;So far so well, my Lady. When I found you here, I was on my way to court
      your waiting-woman, but she does not expect me. She has written me her
      answer 'Yes' or 'No' before this, and I shall get it to-morrow in London:
      it was agreed between us she should do so. I was to have started to town
      this afternoon, but I overslept myself&mdash;not but that I got up early
      enough, as Master Walter will witness&mdash;and missed the train from
      Dalwynch. I am going thither to-night; but, in the meantime, I thought I
      could come back and take a farewell kiss from Mary, and her 'Yes' from her
      own lips. I will receive no other answer, and if such should reach me, I
      shall know from whom it comes. The matter is in your hands, I know; come,
      let us part friends.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;God forbid we should part enemies,&rdquo; replied my Lady fervently; &ldquo;I will
      wrong you in nothing, but be assured I shall do my duty at all hazards.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;And be assured I shall have my way, Lady Lisgard, at all risks,&rdquo; returned
      the other grimly. &ldquo;Are you too proud to take my hand at parting?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      For a single instant, my Lady hesitated; then reaching out her fingers,
      they met his own stretched out at fullest length, for the tomb lay between
      them. They shook hands across Sir Robert Lisgard's grave.

    <h2>
      CHAPTER XIV. ONCE MORE IN MY LADY'S CHAMBER.
    </h2>
    <p class="pfirst">
      <span class="dropcap" style="font-size: 4.00em">A</span>S my Lady left the
      churchyard by the wicket-gate, she caught the flutter of a female dress
      that flitted on before her, and vanished in the regions belonging to the
      domestics. Was it possible that anybody had been a witness to her late
      interview, or worse, a listener to the conversation? It was in the highest
      degree improbable, but not impossible. By crouching down behind the low
      stone wall, next Sir Robert's tomb, a person in the Abbey grounds, without
      doubt, could have overheard, and even, with caution, might have watched
      them. It chilled my Lady's heart to think of it. Yet what could be more
      unlikely? What servant of hers would have ventured upon such an outrage?
      Could Mary Forest have so far forgotten herself, actuated by an
      irrepressible curiosity to hear what her mistress and her lover could have
      to say to one another at that strange time and place? It was much more
      probable that some domestic about to use the short-cut through the
      churchyard, had seen her coming from it, and hastened back, to avoid a
      meeting. At the same time, the suspicion added to my Lady's troubles.
    </p>
    <p>
      These were serious and pressing enough already, Heaven help her! and yet,
      urgent and perilous as they were, it was not of them that she first
      thought when she found herself once more in her own room. There are no
      circumstances, however tremendous, which have power to quench the
      susceptibilities of women: their feelings must have way, no matter how
      dangerous the indulgence in them, how immediate the necessity for action.
      The meshes of a net which threatened destruction to herself and all that
      were dear to her were closing in around Lady Lisgard, and, calm as she
      looked, she knew it well&mdash;well as the wily salmon that poises
      motionless, and seemingly unconscious of his peril, in the red pool, below
      which the fisherman has set the spreading snare; but my Lady turns her
      back for a little upon the tide of woes that is setting in upon her&mdash;a
      spring-tide that may reach Heaven knows how far&mdash;and seeks the inland
      Past. It is the last time that she will ever visit it, and therefore she
      cannot choose but linger there a while, and shed some bitter tears. Her
      door is locked, for none must see her wishing &ldquo;Good-bye,&rdquo; and the windows
      are wide open to the air, which blows the flame of her reading-lamp hither
      and thither. She needs air, poor lady. A waft of wind that has swept some
      snowy steppe would have been grateful to her throbbing brow that April
      night; and as for light, a very little is enough for her purpose. Those
      few old letters she is reading, taken from a secret drawer in my Lady's
      desk, are as familiar to her as her prayers, and she seems to hold them
      almost as sacred. Yet one is not even a letter, but only a piece of folded
      note-paper, torn at the creases, and yellow&mdash;nay, yellower than mere
      age could possibly have turned it. It has been damaged by seawater. Within
      it are two locks of hair, quite white, and a few words in faded ink, <i>Frank
      Meade</i> and <i>Rachel Meade</i>, with a date of five-and-thirty years
      ago.
    </p>
    <p>
      She takes out the silver tresses, and looking on them reverently for a few
      moments, kisses them, and puts them back in the secret drawer&mdash;but
      not the writing; that she holds above the lamp until it has caught fire,
      and watches it until it is quite consumed, and the last spark has gone
      out. Then she brings forth from the same hiding-place two letters,
      evidently both by the same hand&mdash;a very unclerkly one&mdash;ill-spelled
      and ill-composed, but which have been to her more dear than any written
      words for a quarter of a century; for they were letters of a dead man,
      written, the one when he was her accepted lover, the other after he became
      her husband. They are letters of the Dead no longer; for he who was
      thought to have died is still alive, and being so, has become an enemy
      more terrible than any who should seek her life; one who, by simply
      saying: &ldquo;This is my wife,&rdquo; would thereby dishonour her, disgrace her
      children, and even shame the memory of that righteous man whose tomb she
      had just visited, and wept over with such honest tears. And yet with
      tenderness, though mixed with a certain awe and shrinking, does my Lady
      look upon those time-worn words, notwithstanding that the sacredness of
      Death is no longer on them. The first is what is called a love-letter, a
      note filled with foolish fondness, expressed with vehemence, but without
      coarseness; the second a tissue of passionate self-reproaches; the writer
      accusing himself of bringing a curse upon her happy home in having married
      her; then stating, as though reluctantly, certain arrangements he had made
      at the seaport,-from which his communication was dated, for the passage of
      herself and parents by the <i>North Star</i>. Both are signed <i>Ralph
      Gavestone</i>.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;So loving and so penitent,&rdquo; murmurs she, &ldquo;Time cannot surely have worked
      so ill with such a nature as he would have me believe! When he first sang
      that carol to my ear, I thought it might have been an angel singing:
    </p>
    <p>
      <br />
    </p>
    <p class="indent15">
      O'er the hill and o'er the vale
    </p>
    <p class="indent20">
      Come three kings together.
    </p>
    <p>
      <br />
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Alas, alas! to think with what terror I heard him sing it the last time.
      He may not be more changed within, perhaps, than he is without; since,
      notwithstanding what he said about his looks, I knew him again the first
      moment my eye lit upon him on yonder lawn. I wonder whether he would have
      known <i>me</i>, supposing he had snatched away my veil. Merciful Heaven,
      what a risk was that! nay, is not every moment that he remains at Mirk a
      risk! What if he heard the name of Gavestone coupled with mine? I am sure
      he recognised something in my voice, although I disguised it all I could.
      He must never come back hither&mdash;never, never! He must be as dead to
      me now as I deemed him to be before. God knows I pity him from the bottom
      of my heart: and also&rdquo;&mdash;here she paused&mdash;&ldquo;yes, and also that I
      do not love him&mdash;no, not him, although I love the man that wrote
      these words. I never concealed it, no, never, from my&mdash;Sir Robert
      himself. I said: 'I have no love to give you,' all along; 'only respect,
      devotion, duty.' And those, Heaven knows, I gave. If all together, and a
      hundred other gracious feelings added, could have made up love, then Sir
      Robert would have had that; but they can <i>not</i>. He knew it, noble
      heart, and was content. He knew that in that drawer I kept these very
      things that came on shore with me when&mdash;&mdash;O Ralph, Ralph,
      Ralph!&rdquo; My Lady shook with sobs; and then, in her agony, mistaking the
      noise of her own passion for some interruption from without, started up
      from the desk on which she had thrown herself, and listened.
    </p>
    <p>
      Nothing was to be heard save a faint peal of laughter from the
      croquet-ground, where Walter and the two young ladies were endeavouring to
      play by lantern-light&mdash;a frolic she had heard them planning at
      dinner-time. Yet even that slight tidings from the world without recalled
      her to the present. &ldquo;I must burn all proofs,&rdquo; she murmured, as though
      repeating some authoritative command of another rather than any
      determination of her own. Then with a steady hand she took the letters,
      and burned them to the last atom, reading the words with greediness, as
      though, as the flame consumed them one by one, the remainder had grown
      more precious, like the Sibyl's books. There was more to try her yet. The
      last thing which the little drawer contained had yet to be brought forth&mdash;a
      leaden locket, the facsimile of the one which Derrick had just shewn to
      her in the churchyard. Within, although almost, as he had expressed it,
      &ldquo;dried to dust,&rdquo; was a tiny sprig of wood. She emptied this into the
      hollow of her hand, and instantly the wind whirled all away. My Lady
      uttered a low moan of anguish, then sat with the poor token in her hand,
      which, worthless and vacant as it was, yet, to her streaming eyes, held
      all the treasure of her youth. &ldquo;Alas, alas, for the time that is no more!&rdquo;
       cried she. &ldquo;Who could have thought that I, with my own hand, should
      destroy this precious pledge? Kind Heaven, direct me&mdash;teach me what
      it is right to do! Till death should part us, did I swear to cherish him;
      and now, though we both live, alone he roves the world. It may be I should
      win him back to his former self, and save a soul alive. He has loved me
      always&mdash;always; and he loves me now, although he deems I have lain
      beneath the waves these thirty years, and although he seeks&mdash;&mdash;&mdash;
      But that shall never he. I will tell Mary Forest rather to her face: 'I
      myself am married to this man whom you would wed.' He shall not bring
      another sin upon himself and shame on her, and&mdash;&mdash;Ah, Heaven
      help me; what is that which I should do in this sad strait?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      It was terrible to see my Lady's look of woe, as, rising from her chair,
      she paced the room, and now prayed Heaven for aid, and now stood listening
      to the mirth that still broke in from out of doors by fits, and now gazed
      fixedly upon the little leaden case within her hand, as though there were
      some magic help in that. &ldquo;Farewell, Lucy,&rdquo; murmured she; &ldquo;the last words
      that I ever thought to hear him say, which, having said, he dropped, to
      save my life, into the wave. And now I see him storm-tossed in the sea of
      sin, certain to sink, without a plank but this poor ancient love of his to
      which to cling, and yet I may not stretch a finger forth to aid him. Ah
      me, what base return! Why did I not cleave to him, although I thought him
      dead, as he to me? Why was I not faithful to his memory, as he to mine?
      Why say: 'In three years' time, Sir Robert, if your fancy still holds
      firm, I will be yours?' Why not repeat that 'No' I gave him first? Then,
      earning my own living as I was born to earn it, I might have lived on
      alone until this day, when, meeting with my poor lost Ralph once more, I
      could, without a blush of shame, cry 'Husband!' and be to him indeed the
      guardian angel his love paints I was. Heaven knows, I wish it for his sake
      alone. I wish for nothing for myself but Death&mdash;yes, that would be
      best of all, a thousand times.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      My Lady's once plump face looked pinched and worn, almost as though the
      Shadow for which she sighed was really nigh; her anxious eyes, not
      softened by her tears, peered timorous as a hare's to left and right, as
      though the tenantless room held some one who could read her secret soul.
      Then sitting down upon the sofa, with her hands clenched before her, she
      stared out upon the twilight, deepening down upon the windmill on the
      hill. But presently, &ldquo;Forgive me these black thoughts,&rdquo; prayed she with
      inward shudder. &ldquo;If, as they say, the place reserved for the wicked is
      filled with those who have promised themselves to do some good, and have
      not done it, then haply those who in their minds revolve some deadly sin
      which they do not commit, may be forgiven. I will not, with God's
      blessing, thus transgress again. I <i>know</i> that that is wrong, and
      prompted by the devil; but which is right and which is wrong in this&rdquo;
       (once more her eyes fell piteously upon the locket in her hand)&mdash;&ldquo;Lord
      help me in this trial.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Here Walter's ringing voice was heard upon the lawn beneath: &ldquo;Never mind
      pulling up the rings, Letty; they are the best burglar-trap a householder
      can lay; only bring in the mallets and balls.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;My Walter!&rdquo; exclaimed my Lady, starting up with haste. &ldquo;Have I forgotten
      <i>you</i>, then? My proud Sir Richard, too, disgraced, dishonoured, shall
      men call you bastard? My sweet Letty&mdash;never, never, never!&rdquo; As though
      she dared not trust herself to think, she kept repeating that sad word:
      then thrusting the dear token in the centre of the wood and coals that
      were laid in the fireplace ready for the match, she set all alight.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Better for one to suffer than for three,&rdquo; she muttered to herself. &ldquo;The
      die is cast. I am My Lady still. I would my heart could melt away like
      this dull lead, and weigh me down no more, and with this last relic of the
      past, that every thought of it might likewise perish. It can never he, I
      know. While this my life still holds&mdash;a life of lies, a whited
      sepulchre&mdash;this sting will never lose its venom&mdash;never, never!&mdash;Shade
      of the dead,&rdquo; cried she with vehemence, turning toward the old
      church-tower, which stood up black against the rising moon, &ldquo;I charge you,
      witness what I do for you and yours! Here, in this flame, I sacrifice not
      only this poor token, but the man that was my husband; nay, who <i>is</i>,
      the man that I once loved, nay, whom I love now; the man that laid his
      life down for my sake, with those two words, just 'Farewell, Lucy.' Great
      Heaven, is not this enough? Surely, now all will go well&mdash;save for
      him and me. Is this too much to ask?... Forgive, forgive: I know not what
      I said. Teach me to be humble, patient under every blow, and no more vain
      regrets. I must act at once. What did Arthur say? 'The matter lay in my
      own hands,' said he, whether this man should stay at Mirk or not. How
      little did he know with what truth he spoke! And I must speak to Mary
      without delay, for that I alone could stop her marriage with this man. How
      true again? Well, I will do it.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Then my Lady washed her swollen eyes, and smoothed her hair, all tangled
      and escaped from its sober bonds, unturned the door-key, and having rung
      her bell, awaited with the lamp so placed that it threw her face in
      shadow, the coming of her waiting-maid.
